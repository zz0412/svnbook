<p>At some point, you're going to need to understand how your Subversion client
communicates with its server.  Subversion's networking layer is abstracted,
meaning that Subversion clients exhibit the same general behaviors no matter
what sort of server they are operating against.  Whether speaking the HTTP
protocol (<code class="literal">http://</code>) with the Apache HTTP Server or
speaking the custom Subversion protocol (<code class="literal">svn://</code>) with
<span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, the basic network model is the same.  In this
section, we'll explain the basics of that network model, including how
Subversion manages authentication and authorization matters.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.reqresp"></a>3.11.1. 请求和响应</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The Subversion client spends most of its time managing working copies.  When
it needs information from a remote repository, however, it makes a network
request, and the server responds with an appropriate answer.  The details of
the network protocol are hidden from the user—the client attempts to
access a URL, and depending on the URL scheme, a particular protocol is used
to contact the server (see the sidebar <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.wc.sb-1" title="版本库的 URL">版本库的 URL</a>).</p>

</table></div>
<p>When the server process receives a client request, it often demands that the
client identify itself.  It issues an authentication challenge to the
client, and the client responds by providing
<em class="firstterm">credentials</em> back to the server.  Once authentication
is complete, the server responds with the original information that the
client asked for.  Notice that this system is different from systems such as
CVS, where the client preemptively offers credentials (“<span class="quote">logs
in</span>”) to the server before ever making a request.  In Subversion, the
server “<span class="quote">pulls</span>” credentials by challenging the client at the
appropriate moment, rather than the client “<span class="quote">pushing</span>” them.
This makes certain operations more elegant.  For example, if a server is
configured to allow anyone in the world to read a repository, the server
will never issue an authentication challenge when a client attempts to
<span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>.</p>
<p>If the particular network requests issued by the client result in a new
revision being created in the repository (e.g., <span class="command"><strong>svn
commit</strong></span>), Subversion uses the authenticated username associated
with those requests as the author of the revision.  That is, the
authenticated user's name is stored as the value of the
<code class="literal">svn:author</code> property on the new revision (see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.properties.html" title="9.10. Subversion 属性">第 9.10 节 “Subversion 属性”</a>).  If the client was not authenticated (i.e.,
if the server never issued an authentication challenge), the revision's
<code class="literal">svn:author</code> property is empty.

<a name="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"></a>3.11.2. 客户端凭证缓存</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Many servers are configured to require authentication on every request.
This would be a big annoyance to users if they were forced to type their
passwords over and over again.  Fortunately, the Subversion client has a
remedy for this—a built-in system for caching authentication
credentials on disk.  By default, whenever the command-line client
successfully responds to a server's authentication challenge, credentials
are cached on disk and keyed on a combination of the server's hostname,
port, and authentication realm.</p>
<p>When the client receives an authentication challenge, it first looks for the
appropriate credentials in the user's disk cache.  If seemingly suitable
credentials are not present, or if the cached credentials ultimately fail to
authenticate, the client will, by default, fall back to prompting the user
for the necessary information.</p>
<p>The security-conscious reader will suspect immediately that there is reason
for concern here.  “<span class="quote">Caching passwords on disk? That's terrible! You
should never do that!</span>”</p>
<p>The Subversion developers recognize the legitimacy of such concerns, and so
Subversion works with available mechanisms provided by the operating system
and environment to try to minimize the risk of leaking this information.
Here's a breakdown of what this means for users on the most common
platforms:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>On Windows, the Subversion client stores passwords in the
<code class="filename">%APPDATA%/Subversion/auth/</code> directory. On Windows 2000
and later, the standard Windows cryptography services are used to encrypt
the password on disk.  Because the encryption key is managed by Windows and
is tied to the user's own login credentials, only the user can decrypt the
cached password.  (Note that if the user's Windows account password is reset
by an administrator, all of the cached passwords become undecipherable.  The
Subversion client will behave as though they don't exist, prompting for
passwords when required.)</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, on Mac OS X, the Subversion client stores all repository
passwords in the login keyring (managed by the Keychain service), which is
protected by the user's account password.  User preference settings can
impose additional policies, such as requiring that the user's account
password be entered each time the Subversion password is used.</p></li>
<li><p>For other Unix-like operating systems, no standard “<span class="quote">keychain</span>”
services exist.  However, the Subversion client knows how to store password
securely using the “<span class="quote">GNOME Keyring</span>” and “<span class="quote">KDE
Wallet</span>” services.  Also, before storing unencrypted passwords in the
<code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code> caching area, the Subversion client
will ask the user for permission to do so.  Note that the
<code class="filename">auth/</code> caching area is still permission-protected so
that only the user (owner) can read data from it, not the world at large.
The operating system's own file permissions protect the passwords from other
non-administrative users on the same system, provided they have no direct
physical access to the storage media of the home directory, or backups
thereof.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Of course, for the truly paranoid, none of these mechanisms meets the test
of perfection.  So for those folks willing to sacrifice convenience for the
ultimate in security, Subversion provides various ways of disabling its
credentials caching system altogether.</p>
<p>你可以关闭凭证缓存，只需要一个简单的命令，使用参数<code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code>：</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -F log_msg.txt --no-auth-cache
Authentication realm: &lt;svn://host.example.com:3690&gt; example realm
Username:  joe
Password for 'joe':

Adding         newfile
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2324.

# password was not cached, so a second commit still prompts us

$ svn delete newfile
$ svn commit -F new_msg.txt
Authentication realm: &lt;svn://host.example.com:3690&gt; example realm
Username:  joe
…
</pre>
<p>Or, if you want to disable credential caching permanently, you can edit the
<code class="filename">config</code> file in your runtime configuration area and set
the <code class="option">store-auth-creds</code> option to <code class="literal">no</code>.  This
will prevent the storing of credentials used in any Subversion interactions
you perform on the affected computer.  This can be extended to cover all
users on the computer, too, by modifying the system-wide runtime
configuration area (described in <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.layout" title="7.1.1. 配置区布局">第 7.1.1 节 “配置区布局”</a>).</p>
<pre class="screen">
[auth]
store-auth-creds = no
</pre>
<p>Sometimes users will want to remove specific credentials from the disk
cache.  To do this, you need to navigate into the <code class="filename">auth/</code>
area and manually delete the appropriate cache file.  Credentials are cached
in individual files; if you look inside each file, you will see keys and
values.  The <code class="literal">svn:realmstring</code> key describes the particular
server realm that the file is associated with:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ ls ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/
5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28
3893ed123b39500bca8a0b382839198e
5c3c22968347b390f349ff340196ed39

$ cat ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28

K 8
username
V 3
joe
K 8
password
V 4
blah
K 15
svn:realmstring
V 45
&lt;https://svn.domain.com:443&gt; Joe's repository
END
</pre>
<p>一旦你定位了正确的缓存文件，只需要删除它。</p>
<p>One last word about <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>'s authentication behavior,
specifically regarding the <code class="option">--username</code> and
<code class="option">--password</code> options.  Many client subcommands accept these
options, but it is important to understand that using these options does
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> automatically send credentials to the server.  As
discussed earlier, the server “<span class="quote">pulls</span>” credentials from the
client when it deems necessary; the client cannot “<span class="quote">push</span>” them
at will.  If a username and/or password are passed as options, they will be
presented to the server only if the server requests them.  These options are
typically used to authenticate as a different user than Subversion would
have chosen by default (such as your system login name) or when trying to
avoid interactive prompting (such as when calling <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
from a script).</p>

authentication challenge.  When users pass <code class="option">--username</code> and

<p>这里是Subversion客户端在收到认证请求的时候的行为方式最终总结：</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>First, the client checks whether the user specified any credentials as
command-line options (<code class="option">--username</code> and/or
<code class="option">--password</code>).  If so, the client will try to use those
credentials to authenticate against the server.</p></li>
<li><p>If no command-line credentials were provided, or the provided ones were
invalid, the client looks up the server's hostname, port, and realm in the
runtime configuration's <code class="filename">auth/</code> area, to see whether
appropriate credentials are cached there.  If so, it attempts to use those
credentials to authenticate.</p></li>
<li><p>最终，如果前一种机制未能够为服务器成功认证用户，客户端返回并提示用户输入正确的凭证(除非使用<code class="option">--non-interactive</code>选项或客户端对等的方式)。</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>如果客户端通过以上的任何一种方式成功认证，它会尝试在磁盘缓存凭证(除非用户已经关闭了这种行为方式，在前面提到过。)</p>
