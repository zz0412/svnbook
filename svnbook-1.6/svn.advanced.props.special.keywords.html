<p>Subversion has the ability to substitute
<em class="firstterm">keywords</em>—pieces of useful, dynamic information
about a versioned file—into the contents of the file itself.  Keywords
generally provide information about the last modification made to the file.
Because this information changes each time the file changes, and more
importantly, just <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the file changes, it is a
hassle for any process except the version control system to keep the data
completely up to date.  Left to human authors, the information would
inevitably grow stale.</p>
<p>For example, say you have a document in which you would like to display the
last date on which it was modified.  You could burden every author of that
document to, just before committing their changes, also tweak the part of
the document that describes when it was last changed.  But sooner or later,
someone would forget to do that.  Instead, simply ask Subversion to perform
keyword substitution on the <code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code> keyword.  You
control where the keyword is inserted into your document by placing a
<em class="firstterm">keyword anchor</em> at the desired location in the file.
This anchor is just a string of text formatted as
<code class="literal">$</code><em class="replaceable"><code>KeywordName</code></em><code class="literal">$</code>.</p>
<p>All keywords are case-sensitive where they appear as anchors in files: you
must use the correct capitalization for the keyword to be expanded.  You
should consider the value of the <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property to
be case-sensitive, too—certain keyword names will be recognized
regardless of case, but this behavior is deprecated.</p>
<p>Subversion defines the list of keywords available for substitution.  That
list contains the following five keywords, some of which have aliases that
you can also use:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Date</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This keyword describes the last time the file was known to have been changed
in the repository, and is of the form <code class="literal">$Date: 2006-07-22 21:42:37
-0700 (Sat, 22 Jul 2006) $</code>.  It may also be specified as
<code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code>.  Unlike the <code class="literal">Id</code>
keyword, which uses UTC, the <code class="literal">Date</code> keyword displays dates
using the local time zone.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Revision</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This keyword describes the last known revision in which this file changed in
the repository, and looks something like <code class="literal">$Revision: 144
$</code>.  It may also be specified as
<code class="literal">LastChangedRevision</code> or <code class="literal">Rev</code>.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Author</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This keyword describes the last known user to change this file in the
repository, and looks something like <code class="literal">$Author: harry $</code>.
It may also be specified as <code class="literal">LastChangedBy</code>.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">HeadURL</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This keyword describes the full URL to the latest version of the file in the
repository, and looks something like <code class="literal">$HeadURL:
http://svn.collab.net/repos/trunk/README $</code>.  It may be abbreviated
as <code class="literal">URL</code>.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Id</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This keyword is a compressed combination of the other keywords.  Its
substitution looks something like <code class="literal">$Id: calc.c 148 2006-07-28
21:30:43Z sally $</code>, and is interpreted to mean that the file
<code class="filename">calc.c</code> was last changed in revision 148 on the evening
of July 28, 2006 by the user <code class="literal">sally</code>.  The date displayed
by this keyword is in UTC, unlike that of the <code class="literal">Date</code>
keyword (which uses the local time zone).</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>Several of the preceding descriptions use the phrase “<span class="quote">last
known</span>” or similar wording.  Keep in mind that keyword expansion is a
client-side operation, and your client “<span class="quote">knows</span>” only about
changes that have occurred in the repository when you update your working
copy to include those changes.  If you never update your working copy, your
keywords will never expand to different values even if those versioned files
are being changed regularly in the repository.</p>
<p>Simply adding keyword anchor text to your file does nothing special.
Subversion will never attempt to perform textual substitutions on your file
contents unless explicitly asked to do so.  After all, you might be writing
a document <sup>[<a name="id358093" href="#ftn.id358093" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup> about how to use keywords,
and you don't want Subversion to substitute your beautiful examples of
unsubstituted keyword anchors!</p>
<p>To tell Subversion whether to substitute keywords on a particular file, we
again turn to the property-related subcommands.  The
<code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property, when set on a versioned file,
controls which keywords will be substituted on that file.  The value is a
space-delimited list of keyword names or aliases.</p>
<p>举个例子，假定你有一个版本化的文件<code class="filename">weather.txt</code>，内容如下：</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate$
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</pre>
<p>With no <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property set on that file,
Subversion will do nothing special.  Now, let's enable substitution of the
<code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code> keyword.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author" weather.txt
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'weather.txt'
$
</pre>
<p>Now you have made a local property modification on the
<code class="filename">weather.txt</code> file.  You will see no changes to the
file's contents (unless you made some of your own prior to setting the
property).  Notice that the file contained a keyword anchor for the
<code class="literal">Rev</code> keyword, yet we did not include that keyword in the
property value we set.  Subversion will happily ignore requests to
substitute keywords that are not present in the file and will not substitute
keywords that are not present in the <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code>
property value.</p>
<p>Immediately after you commit this property change, Subversion will update
your working file with the new substitute text.  Instead of seeing your
keyword anchor <code class="literal">$LastChangedDate$</code>, you'll see its
substituted result.  That result also contains the name of the keyword and
continues to be delimited by the dollar sign (<code class="literal">$</code>)
characters.  And as we predicted, the <code class="literal">Rev</code> keyword was not
substituted because we didn't ask for it to be.</p>
<p>Note also that we set the <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property to
<code class="literal">Date Author</code>, yet the keyword anchor used the alias
<code class="literal">$LastChangedDate$</code> and still expanded correctly:</p>
<pre class="screen">
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate: 2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat, 22 Jul 2006) $
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</pre>
<p>If someone else now commits a change to <code class="filename">weather.txt</code>,
your copy of that file will continue to display the same substituted keyword
value as before—until you update your working copy.  At that time, the
keywords in your <code class="filename">weather.txt</code> file will be resubstituted
with information that reflects the most recent known commit to that file.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>$GlobalRev$ 是什么？</b></p>
<p>New users are often confused by how the <code class="literal">$Rev$</code> keyword
works.  Since the repository has a single, globally increasing revision
number, many people assume that it is this number that is reflected by the
<code class="literal">$Rev$</code> keyword's value.  But <code class="literal">$Rev$</code>
expands to show the last revision in which the file
<span class="emphasis"><em>changed</em></span>, not the last revision to which it was
updated.  Understanding this clears the confusion, but frustration often
remains—without the support of a Subversion keyword to do so, how can
you automatically get the global revision number into your files?</p>
<p>To do this, you need external processing.  Subversion ships with a tool
called <span class="command"><strong>svnversion</strong></span>, which was designed for just this
purpose.  It crawls your working copy and generates as output the
revision(s) it finds.  You can use this program, plus some additional
tooling, to embed that revision information into your files.  For more
information on <span class="command"><strong>svnversion</strong></span>, see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.svnversion.html" title="9.7. svnversion">第 9.7 节 “svnversion”</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Subversion 1.2 introduced a new variant of the keyword syntax, which brought
additional, useful—though perhaps atypical—functionality.  You
can now tell Subversion to maintain a fixed length (in terms of the number
of bytes consumed) for the substituted keyword.  By using a double colon
(<code class="literal">::</code>) after the keyword name, followed by a number of
space characters, you define that fixed width.  When Subversion goes to
substitute your keyword for the keyword and its value, it will essentially
replace only those space characters, leaving the overall width of the
keyword field unchanged.  If the substituted value is shorter than the
defined field width, there will be extra padding characters (spaces) at the
end of the substituted field; if it is too long, it is truncated with a
special hash (<code class="literal">#</code>) character just before the final dollar
sign terminator.</p>
<p>For example, say you have a document in which you have some section of
tabular data reflecting the document's Subversion keywords.  Using the
original Subversion keyword substitution syntax, your file might look
something like:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$Rev$:     Revision of last commit
$Author$:  Author of last commit
$Date$:    Date of last commit
</pre>
<p>Now, that looks nice and tabular at the start of things.  But when you then
commit that file (with keyword substitution enabled, of course), you see:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$Rev: 12 $:     Revision of last commit
$Author: harry $:  Author of last commit
$Date: 2006-03-15 02:33:03 -0500 (Wed, 15 Mar 2006) $:    Date of last commit
</pre>
<p>The result is not so beautiful.  And you might be tempted to then adjust the
file after the substitution so that it again looks tabular.  But that holds
only as long as the keyword values are the same width.  If the last
committed revision rolls into a new place value (say, from 99 to 100), or if
another person with a longer username commits the file, stuff gets all
crooked again.  However, if you are using Subversion 1.2 or later, you can
use the new fixed-length keyword syntax and define some field widths that
seem sane, so your file might look like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$Rev::               $:  Revision of last commit
$Author::            $:  Author of last commit
$Date::              $:  Date of last commit
</pre>
<p>You commit this change to your file.  This time, Subversion notices the new
fixed-length keyword syntax and maintains the width of the fields as defined
by the padding you placed between the double colon and the trailing dollar
sign.  After substitution, the width of the fields is completely
unchanged—the short values for <code class="literal">Rev</code> and
<code class="literal">Author</code> are padded with spaces, and the long
<code class="literal">Date</code> field is truncated by a hash character:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$Rev:: 13            $:  Revision of last commit
$Author:: harry      $:  Author of last commit
$Date:: 2006-03-15 0#$:  Date of last commit
</pre>
<p>固定长度关键字在执行复杂文件格式的替换中非常易用，也可以处理那些很难通过其他程序(例如Microsoft Office文档)进行修改的文件。</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Be aware that because the width of a keyword field is measured in bytes, the
potential for corruption of multibyte values exists.  For example, a
username that contains some multibyte UTF-8 characters might suffer
truncation in the middle of the string of bytes that make up one of those
characters.  The result will be a mere truncation when viewed at the byte
level, but will likely appear as a string with an incorrect or garbled final
character when viewed as UTF-8 text.  It is conceivable that certain
applications, when asked to load the file, would notice the broken UTF-8
text and deem the entire file corrupt, refusing to operate on the file
altogether.  So, when limiting keywords to a fixed size, choose a size that
allows for this type of byte-wise expansion.</p></td></tr>
