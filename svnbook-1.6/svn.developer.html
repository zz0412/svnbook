<p>Subversion has a modular design: it's implemented as a collection of
libraries written in C.  Each library has a well-defined purpose and
application programming interface (API), and that interface is available not
only for Subversion itself to use, but for any software that wishes to embed
or otherwise programmatically control Subversion.  Additionally,
Subversion's API is available not only to other C programs, but also to
programs written in higher-level languages such as Python, Perl, Java, and
Ruby.</p>
<p>This chapter is for those who wish to interact with Subversion through its
public API or its various language bindings.  If you wish to write robust
wrapper scripts around Subversion functionality to simplify your own life,
are trying to develop more complex integrations between Subversion and other
pieces of software, or just have an interest in Subversion's various library
modules and what they offer, this chapter is for you.  If, however, you
don't foresee yourself participating with Subversion at such a level, feel
free to skip this chapter with the confidence that your experience as a
Subversion user will not be affected.</p>

<p>Each of Subversion's core libraries can be said to exist in one of three
main layers—the Repository layer, the Repository Access (RA) layer, or
the Client layer (see <a class="xref" href="svn.intro.whatis.html#svn.intro.architecture.dia-1" title="图 1. Subversion 的架构">图 1 “Subversion 的架构”</a> in the
Preface).  We will examine these layers shortly, but first, let's briefly
summarize Subversion's various libraries.  For the sake of consistency, we
will refer to the libraries by their extensionless Unix library names
(<code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code>, <code class="filename">libsvn_wc</code>,
<code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>The fact that the word “<span class="quote">miscellaneous</span>” appears only once in the
previous list is a good sign.  The Subversion development team is serious
about making sure that functionality lives in the right layer and
libraries.  Perhaps the greatest advantage of the modular design is its lack
of complexity from a developer's point of view.  As a developer, you can
quickly formulate that kind of “<span class="quote">big picture</span>” that allows you to
pinpoint the location of certain pieces of functionality with relative ease.</p>
<p>Another benefit of modularity is the ability to replace a given module with
a whole new library that implements the same API without affecting the rest
of the code base.  In some sense, this happens within Subversion already.
The <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code>,
<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_neon</code>, <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_serf</code>,
and <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code> libraries each implement the same
interface, all working as plug-ins to <code class="filename">libsvn_ra</code>.  And
all four communicate with the Repository
layer—<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code> connects to the repository
directly; the other three do so over a network.  The
<code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code> and <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_fs</code>
libraries are another pair of libraries that implement the same
functionality in different ways—both are plug-ins to the common
<code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> library.</p>
<p>The client itself also highlights the benefits of modularity in the
Subversion design.  Subversion's <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> library
is a one-stop shop for most of the functionality necessary for designing a
working Subversion client (see <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.layerlib.client" title="8.1.3. 客户端层">第 8.1.3 节 “客户端层”</a>).  So while the Subversion
distribution provides only the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> command-line client
program, several third-party programs provide various forms of graphical
client UIs.  These GUIs use the same APIs that the stock command-line client
does.  This type of modularity has played a large role in the proliferation
of available Subversion clients and IDE integrations and, by extension, to
the tremendous adoption rate of Subversion itself.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.developer.layerlib.repos"></a>8.1.1. 版本库层</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When referring to Subversion's Repository layer, we're generally talking
about two basic concepts—the versioned filesystem implementation
(accessed via <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code>, and supported by its
<code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code> and <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_fs</code>
plug-ins), and the repository logic that wraps it (as implemented in
<code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>).  These libraries provide the storage and
reporting mechanisms for the various revisions of your version-controlled
data.  This layer is connected to the Client layer via the Repository Access
layer, and is, from the perspective of the Subversion user, the stuff at the
“<span class="quote">other end of the line.</span>”</p>
<p>The Subversion filesystem is not a kernel-level filesystem that one would
install in an operating system (such as the Linux ext2 or NTFS), but instead
is a virtual filesystem.  Rather than storing “<span class="quote">files</span>” and
“<span class="quote">directories</span>” as real files and directories (the kind you can
navigate through using your favorite shell program), it uses one of two
available abstract storage backends—either a Berkeley DB database
environment or a flat-file representation.  (To learn more about the two
repository backends, see <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends" title="5.2.3. 选择数据存储格式">第 5.2.3 节 “选择数据存储格式”</a>.)
There has even been considerable interest by the development community in
giving future releases of Subversion the ability to use other backend
database systems, perhaps through a mechanism such as Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC).  In fact, Google did something similar to this before
launching the Google Code Project Hosting service: they announced in
mid-2006 that members of its open source team had written a new proprietary
Subversion filesystem plug-in that used Google's ultra-scalable Bigtable
database for its storage.</p>
<p>The filesystem API exported by <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> contains the
kinds of functionality you would expect from any other filesystem
API—you can create and remove files and directories, copy and move
them around, modify file contents, and so on.  It also has features that are
not quite as common, such as the ability to add, modify, and remove metadata
(“<span class="quote">properties</span>”) on each file or directory.  Furthermore, the
Subversion filesystem is a versioning filesystem, which means that as you
make changes to your directory tree, Subversion remembers what your tree
looked like before those changes.  And before the previous changes.  And the
previous ones.  And so on, all the way back through versioning time to (and
just beyond) the moment you first started adding things to the filesystem.</p>
<p>All the modifications you make to your tree are done within the context of a
Subversion commit transaction.  The following is a simplified general
routine for modifying your filesystem:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>开始 Subversion 的提交事务。</p></li>
<li><p>作出修改(添加, 删除, 属性修改等等。)。</p></li>
<li><p>提交事务。</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Once you have committed your transaction, your filesystem modifications are
permanently stored as historical artifacts.  Each of these cycles generates
a single new revision of your tree, and each revision is forever accessible
as an immutable snapshot of “<span class="quote">the way things were.</span>”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>事务的其它信息</b></p>
<p>The notion of a Subversion transaction can become easily confused with the
transaction support provided by the underlying database itself, especially
given the former's close proximity to the Berkeley DB database code in
<code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code>.  Both types of transaction exist to
provide atomicity and isolation.  In other words, transactions give you the
ability to perform a set of actions in an all-or-nothing
fashion—either all the actions in the set complete with success, or
they all get treated as though <span class="emphasis"><em>none</em></span> of them ever
happened—and in a way that does not interfere with other processes
acting on the data.</p>
<p>Database transactions generally encompass small operations related
specifically to the modification of data in the database itself (such as
changing the contents of a table row).  Subversion transactions are larger
in scope, encompassing higher-level operations such as making modifications
to a set of files and directories that are intended to be stored as the next
revision of the filesystem tree.  If that isn't confusing enough, consider
the fact that Subversion uses a database transaction during the creation of
a Subversion transaction (so that if the creation of a Subversion
transaction fails, the database will look as though we had never attempted
that creation in the first place)!</p>
<p>Fortunately for users of the filesystem API, the transaction support
provided by the database system itself is hidden almost entirely from view
(as should be expected from a properly modularized library scheme).  It is
only when you start digging into the implementation of the filesystem itself
that such things become visible (or interesting).</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the functionality the filesystem interface provides deals with
actions that occur on individual filesystem paths.  That is, from outside
the filesystem, the primary mechanism for describing and accessing the
individual revisions of files and directories comes through the use of path
strings such as <code class="filename">/foo/bar</code>, just as though you were
addressing files and directories through your favorite shell program.  You
add new files and directories by passing their paths-to-be to the right API
functions.  You query for information about them by the same mechanism.</p>
<p>Unlike most filesystems, though, a path alone is not enough information to
identify a file or directory in Subversion.  Think of a directory tree as a
two-dimensional system, where a node's siblings represent a sort of
left-and-right motion, and navigating into the node's subdirectories
represents a downward motion.  <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.layerlib.repos.dia-1" title="图 8.1. 二维的文件和目录">图 8.1 “二维的文件和目录”</a> shows a typical
representation of a tree as exactly that.</p>
<div class="figure">

<div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch08dia1.png" alt="二维的文件和目录"></div></div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>The difference here is that the Subversion filesystem has a nifty third
dimension that most filesystems do not have—Time! <sup>[<a name="id382584" href="#ftn.id382584" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup> In the filesystem interface, nearly every function
that has a <em class="parameter"><code>path</code></em> argument also expects a
<em class="parameter"><code>root</code></em> argument.  This <code class="literal">svn_fs_root_t</code>
argument describes either a revision or a Subversion transaction (which is
simply a revision in the making) and provides that third dimension of
context needed to understand the difference between
<code class="filename">/foo/bar</code> in revision 32, and the same path as it exists
in revision 98.  <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.layerlib.repos.dia-2" title="图 8.2. 版本时间 - 第三维！">图 8.2 “版本时间 - 第三维！”</a> shows
revision history as an added dimension to the Subversion filesystem
universe.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a name="svn.developer.layerlib.repos.dia-2"></a><p class="title"><b>图 8.2. 版本时间 - 第三维！</b></p>
<div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch08dia2.png" alt="版本时间 - 第三维！"></div></div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>As we mentioned earlier, the <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> API looks and
feels like any other filesystem, except that it has this wonderful
versioning capability.  It was designed to be usable by any program
interested in a versioning filesystem.  Not coincidentally, Subversion
itself is interested in that functionality.  But while the filesystem API
should be sufficient for basic file and directory versioning support,
Subversion wants more—and that is where
<code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code> comes in.</p>
<p>The Subversion repository library (<code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>) sits
(logically speaking)  atop the <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> API, providing
additional functionality beyond that of the underlying versioned filesystem
logic.  It does not completely wrap each and every filesystem
function—only certain major steps in the general cycle of filesystem
activity are wrapped by the repository interface.  Some of these include the
creation and commit of Subversion transactions and the modification of
revision properties.  These particular events are wrapped by the repository
layer because they have hooks associated with them.  A repository hook
system is not strictly related to implementing a versioning filesystem, so
it lives in the repository wrapper library.</p>
<p>The hooks mechanism is but one of the reasons for the abstraction of a
separate repository library from the rest of the filesystem code.  The
<code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code> API provides several other important
utilities to Subversion.  These include the abilities to:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>在Subversion版本库和版本库包括的文件系统的上创建, 打开, 销毁和执行恢复步骤。</p></li>
<li><p>描述两个文件系统树的区别。</p></li>
<li><p>关于所有(或者部分)修订版本中的文件系统中的一组文件的提交日志信息的查询</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a human-readable “<span class="quote">dump</span>” of the filesystem—a
complete representation of the revisions in the filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>解析导出格式，加载导出的版本到一个不同的Subversion版本库。</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>伴随着Subversion的发展，版本库库会随着文件系统提供更多的功能和配置选项而不断成长。</p>

<p>If the Subversion Repository layer is at “<span class="quote">the other end of the
line,</span>” the Repository Access (RA) layer is the line itself.  Charged
with marshaling data between the client libraries and the repository, this
layer includes the <code class="filename">libsvn_ra</code> module loader library, the
RA modules themselves (which currently includes
<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_neon</code>, <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code>,
<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_serf</code>, and
<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code>), and any additional libraries needed by
one or more of those RA modules (such as the
<code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code> Apache module or
<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code>'s server, <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>).</p>
<p>Since Subversion uses URLs to identify its repository resources, the
protocol portion of the URL scheme (usually <code class="literal">file://</code>,
<code class="literal">http://</code>, <code class="literal">https://</code>,
<code class="literal">svn://</code>, or <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>) is used to
determine which RA module will handle the communications.  Each module
registers a list of the protocols it knows how to “<span class="quote">speak</span>” so
that the RA loader can, at runtime, determine which module to use for the
task at hand.  You can determine which RA modules are available to the
Subversion command-line client, and what protocols they claim to support, by
running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn --version</code></strong>:</p>

Subversion is open source software, see http://subversion.tigris.org/
This product includes software developed by CollabNet (http://www.Collab.Net/).

The following repository access (RA) modules are available:

* ra_neon : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using Neon.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme
* ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network protocol.
  - handles 'svn' scheme
* ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.
  - handles 'file' scheme
* ra_serf : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using serf.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme

<p>The public API exported by the RA layer contains functionality necessary for
sending and receiving versioned data to and from the repository.  And each
of the available RA plug-ins is able to perform that task using a specific
protocol—<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_dav</code> speaks HTTP/WebDAV
(optionally using SSL encryption) with an Apache HTTP Server that is running
the <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code> Subversion server module;
<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code> speaks a custom network protocol with the
<span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program; and so on.</p>
<p>For those who wish to access a Subversion repository using still another
protocol, that is precisely why the Repository Access layer is modularized!
Developers can simply write a new library that implements the RA interface
on one side and communicates with the repository on the other.  Your new
library can use existing network protocols or you can invent your own.  You
could use interprocess communication (IPC) calls, or—let's get crazy,
shall we?—you could even implement an email-based protocol.
Subversion supplies the APIs; you supply the creativity.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.developer.layerlib.client"></a>8.1.3. 客户端层</h3></div></div></div>
<p>On the client side, the Subversion working copy is where all the action
takes place.  The bulk of functionality implemented by the client-side
libraries exists for the sole purpose of managing working
copies—directories full of files and other subdirectories that serve
as a sort of local, editable “<span class="quote">reflection</span>” of one or more
repository locations—and propagating changes to and from the
Repository Access layer.</p>
<p>Subversion's working copy library, <code class="filename">libsvn_wc</code>, is
directly responsible for managing the data in the working copies.  To
accomplish this, the library stores administrative information about each
working copy directory within a special subdirectory.  This subdirectory,
named <code class="filename">.svn</code>, is present in each working copy directory
and contains various other files and directories that record state and
provide a private workspace for administrative action.  For those familiar
with CVS, this <code class="filename">.svn</code> subdirectory is similar in purpose
to the <code class="filename">CVS</code> administrative directories found in CVS
working copies.  For more information about the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
administrative area, see <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.insidewc.html" title="8.2. 进入工作副本的管理区">第 8.2 节 “进入工作副本的管理区”</a> later in
this chapter.</p>
<p>The Subversion client library, <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code>, has the
broadest responsibility; its job is to mingle the functionality of the
working copy library with that of the Repository Access layer, and then to
provide the highest-level API to any application that wishes to perform
general revision control actions.  For example, the function
<code class="function">svn_client_checkout()</code> takes a URL as an argument.  It
passes this URL to the RA layer and opens an authenticated session with a
particular repository.  It then asks the repository for a certain tree, and
sends this tree into the working copy library, which then writes a full
working copy to disk (<code class="filename">.svn</code> directories and all).</p>
<p>The client library is designed to be used by any application.  While the
Subversion source code includes a standard command-line client, it should be
very easy to write any number of GUI clients on top of the client library.
New GUIs (or any new client, really) for Subversion need not be clunky
wrappers around the included command-line client—they have full access
via the <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> API to the same functionality,
data, and callback mechanisms that the command-line client uses.  In fact,
the Subversion source code tree contains a small C program (which you can
find at <code class="filename">tools/examples/minimal_client.c</code>) that
exemplifies how to wield the Subversion API to create a simple client
program.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>直接绑定 - 关于正确性</b></p>
<p>Why should your GUI program bind directly with a
<code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> instead of acting as a wrapper around a
command-line program? Besides simply being more efficient, it can be more
correct as well.  A command-line program (such as the one supplied with
Subversion) that binds to the client library needs to effectively translate
feedback and requested data bits from C types to some form of human-readable
output.  This type of translation can be lossy.  That is, the program may
not display all of the information harvested from the API or may combine
bits of information for compact representation.</p>
<p>If you wrap such a command-line program with yet another program, the second
program has access only to already interpreted (and as we mentioned, likely
incomplete)  information, which it must <span class="emphasis"><em>again</em></span> translate
into <span class="emphasis"><em>its</em></span> representation format.  With each layer of
wrapping, the integrity of the original data is potentially tainted more and
more, much like the result of making a copy of a copy (of a copy…)
of a favorite audio or video cassette.</p>
<p>But the most compelling argument for binding directly to the APIs instead of
wrapping other programs is that the Subversion project makes compatibility
promises regarding its APIs.  Across minor versions of those APIs (such as
between 1.3 and 1.4), no function's prototype will change.  In other words,
you aren't forced to update your program's source code simply because you've
upgraded to a new version of Subversion.  Certain functions might be
deprecated, but they still work, and this gives you a buffer of time to
eventually embrace the newer APIs.  These kinds of compatibility promises do
not exist for Subversion command-line program output, which is subject to
change from release to release.</p>
