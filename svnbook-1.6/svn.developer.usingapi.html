<p>Developing applications against the Subversion library APIs is fairly
straightforward.  Subversion is primarily a set of C libraries, with header
(<code class="filename">.h</code>) files that live in the
<code class="filename">subversion/include</code> directory of the source tree.  These
headers are copied into your system locations (e.g.,
<code class="filename">/usr/local/include</code>)  when you build and install
Subversion itself from source.  These headers represent the entirety of the
functions and types meant to be accessible by users of the Subversion
libraries.  The Subversion developer community is meticulous about ensuring
that the public API is well documented—refer directly to the header
files for that documentation.</p>
<p>When examining the public header files, the first thing you might notice is
that Subversion's datatypes and functions are namespace-protected.  That is,
every public Subversion symbol name begins with <code class="literal">svn_</code>,
followed by a short code for the library in which the symbol is defined
(such as <code class="literal">wc</code>, <code class="literal">client</code>,
<code class="literal">fs</code>, etc.), followed by a single underscore
(<code class="literal">_</code>), and then the rest of the symbol name.  Semipublic
functions (used among source files of a given library but not by code
outside that library, and found inside the library directories themselves)
differ from this naming scheme in that instead of a single underscore after
the library code, they use a double underscore
(<code class="literal">_ _</code>).  Functions that are private to a given
source file have no special prefixing and are declared
<code class="literal">static</code>.  Of course, a compiler isn't interested in these
naming conventions, but they help to clarify the scope of a given function
or datatype.</p>
<p>Another good source of information about programming against the Subversion
APIs is the project's own hacking guidelines, which you can find at <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html</a>.  This document contains
useful information, which, while aimed at developers and would-be developers
of Subversion itself, is equally applicable to folks developing against
Subversion as a set of third-party libraries.  <sup>[<a name="id383481" href="#ftn.id383481" class="footnote">54</a>]</sup>

<a name="svn.developer.usingapi.apr"></a>8.3.1. Apache 可移植运行库</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Along with Subversion's own datatypes, you will see many references to
datatypes that begin with <code class="literal">apr_</code>—symbols from the
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library.  APR is Apache's portability library,
originally carved out of its server code as an attempt to separate the
OS-specific bits from the OS-independent portions of the code.  The result
was a library that provides a generic API for performing operations that
differ mildly—or wildly—from OS to OS.  While the Apache HTTP
Server was obviously the first user of the APR library, the Subversion
developers immediately recognized the value of using APR as well.  This
means that there is practically no OS-specific code in Subversion itself.
Also, it means that the Subversion client compiles and runs anywhere that
the Apache HTTP Server does.  Currently, this list includes all flavors of
Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, and Mac OS X.</p>
<p>In addition to providing consistent implementations of system calls that
differ across operating systems, <sup>[<a name="id383522" href="#ftn.id383522" class="footnote">55</a>]</sup> APR
gives Subversion immediate access to many custom datatypes, such as dynamic
arrays and hash tables.  Subversion uses these types extensively.  But
perhaps the most pervasive APR datatype, found in nearly every Subversion
API prototype, is the <code class="literal">apr_pool_t</code>—the APR memory
pool.  Subversion uses pools internally for all its memory allocation needs
(unless an external library requires a different memory management mechanism
for data passed through its API), <sup>[<a name="id383539" href="#ftn.id383539" class="footnote">56</a>]</sup> and
while a person coding against the Subversion APIs is not required to do the
same, she <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> required to provide pools to the API
functions that need them.  This means that users of the Subversion API must
also link against APR, must call <code class="function">apr_initialize()</code> to
initialize the APR subsystem, and then must create and manage pools for use
with Subversion API calls, typically by using
<code class="function">svn_pool_create()</code>,
<code class="function">svn_pool_clear()</code>, and
<code class="function">svn_pool_destroy()</code>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>使用内存池编程</b></p>
<p>Almost every developer who has used the C programming language has at some
point sighed at the daunting task of managing memory usage.  Allocating
enough memory to use, keeping track of those allocations, freeing the memory
when you no longer need it—these tasks can be quite complex.  And of
course, failure to do those things properly can result in a program that
crashes itself, or worse, crashes the computer.</p>
<p>Higher-level languages, on the other hand, either take the job of memory
management away from you completely or make it something you toy with only
when doing extremely tight program optimization.  Languages such as Java and
Python use <em class="firstterm">garbage collection</em>, allocating memory for
objects when needed, and automatically freeing that memory when the object
is no longer in use.</p>
<p>APR provides a middle-ground approach called <em class="firstterm">pool-based memory
management</em>.  It allows the developer to control memory usage at
a lower resolution—per chunk (or “<span class="quote">pool</span>”) of memory,
instead of per allocated object.  Rather than using
<code class="function">malloc()</code> and friends to allocate enough memory for a
given object, you ask APR to allocate the memory from a memory pool.  When
you're finished using the objects you've created in the pool, you destroy
the entire pool, effectively de-allocating the memory consumed by
<span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the objects you allocated from it.  Thus, rather
than keeping track of individual objects that need to be de-allocated, your
program simply considers the general lifetimes of those objects and
allocates the objects in a pool whose lifetime (the time between the pool's
creation and its deletion) matches the object's needs.</p>

<p>With remote version control operation as the whole point of Subversion's
existence, it makes sense that some attention has been paid to
internationalization (i18n) support.  After all, while “<span class="quote">remote</span>”
might mean “<span class="quote">across the office,</span>” it could just as well mean
“<span class="quote">across the globe.</span>” To facilitate this, all of Subversion's
public interfaces that accept path arguments expect those paths to be
canonicalized—which is most easily accomplished by passing them
through the <code class="function">svn_path_canonicalize()</code> function—and
encoded in UTF-8.  This means, for example, that any new client binary that
drives the <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> interface needs to first
convert paths from the locale-specific encoding to UTF-8 before passing
those paths to the Subversion libraries, and then reconvert any resultant
output paths from Subversion back into the locale's encoding before using
those paths for non-Subversion purposes.  Fortunately, Subversion provides a
suite of functions (see <code class="filename">subversion/include/svn_utf.h</code>)
that any program can use to do these conversions.</p>
<p>Also, Subversion APIs require all URL parameters to be properly
URI-encoded.  So, instead of passing <code class="uri">file:///home/username/My
File.txt</code> as the URL of a file named <code class="filename">My File.txt</code>,
you need to pass <code class="uri">file:///home/username/My%20File.txt</code>.  Again,
Subversion supplies helper functions that your application can
use—<code class="function">svn_path_uri_encode()</code> and
<code class="function">svn_path_uri_decode()</code>, for URI encoding and decoding,
respectively.</p>

<p>If you are interested in using the Subversion libraries in conjunction with
something other than a C program—say, a Python or Perl
script—Subversion has some support for this via the Simplified Wrapper
and Interface Generator (SWIG).  The SWIG bindings for Subversion are
located in <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/swig</code>.  They are still
maturing, but they are usable.  These bindings allow you to call Subversion
API functions indirectly, using wrappers that translate the datatypes native
to your scripting language into the datatypes needed by Subversion's C
libraries.</p>
<p>Significant efforts have been made toward creating functional SWIG-generated
bindings for Python, Perl, and Ruby.  To some extent, the work done
preparing the SWIG interface files for these languages is reusable in
efforts to generate bindings for other languages supported by SWIG (which
include versions of C#, Guile, Java, MzScheme, OCaml, PHP, and Tcl, among
others).  However, some extra programming is required to compensate for
complex APIs that SWIG needs some help translating between languages.  For
more information on SWIG itself, see the project's web site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.swig.org/" target="_top">http://www.swig.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Subversion also has language bindings for Java.  The javahl bindings
(located in <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/java</code> in the Subversion
source tree) aren't SWIG-based, but are instead a mixture of Java and
hand-coded JNI.  Javahl covers most Subversion client-side APIs and is
specifically targeted at implementors of Java-based Subversion clients and
IDE integrations.</p>
<p>Subversion's language bindings tend to lack the level of developer attention
given to the core Subversion modules, but can generally be trusted as
production-ready.  A number of scripts and applications, alternative
Subversion GUI clients, and other third-party tools are successfully using
Subversion's language bindings today to accomplish their Subversion
integrations.</p>
<p>It's worth noting here that there are other options for interfacing with
Subversion using other languages: alternative bindings for Subversion that
aren't provided by the Subversion development community at all.  You can
find links to these alternative bindings on the Subversion project's links
page (at <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html</a>), but there
are a couple of popular ones we feel are especially noteworthy.  First,
Barry Scott's PySVN bindings (<a class="ulink" href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://pysvn.tigris.org/</a>) are
a popular option for binding with Python.  PySVN boasts of a more Pythonic
interface than the more C-like APIs provided by Subversion's own Python
bindings.  And if you're looking for a pure Java implementation of
Subversion, check out SVNKit (<a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>), which is
Subversion rewritten from the ground up in Java.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>SVNKit 与 javahl</b></p>
<p>In 2005, a small company called TMate announced the 1.0.0 release of
JavaSVN—a pure Java implementation of Subversion.  Since then, the
project has been renamed to SVNKit (available at <a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>)  and has seen great success as a provider of
Subversion functionality to various Subversion clients, IDE integrations,
and other third-party tools.</p>
<p>The SVNKit library is interesting in that, unlike the javahl library, it is
not merely a wrapper around the official Subversion core libraries.  In
fact, it shares no code with Subversion at all.  But while it is easy to
confuse SVNKit with javahl, and easier still to not even realize which of
these libraries you are using, folks should be aware that SVNKit differs
from javahl in some significant ways.  First, SVNKit is not developed as
open source software and seems to have at any given time only a few
developers working on it.  Also, SVNKit's license is more restrictive than
that of Subversion.  Finally, by aiming to be a pure Java Subversion
library, SVNKit is limited in which portions of Subversion can be reasonably
cloned while still keeping up with Subversion's releases.  This has already
happened once—SVNKit cannot access BDB-backed Subversion repositories
via the <code class="literal">file://</code> protocol because there's no pure Java
implementation of Berkeley DB that is file-format-compatible with the native
implementation of that library.</p>
<p>That said, SVNKit has a well-established track record of reliability.  And a
pure Java solution is much more robust in the face of programming
errors—a bug in SVNKit might raise a catchable Java Exception, but a
bug in the Subversion core libraries as accessed via javahl can bring down
your entire Java Runtime Environment.  So, weigh the costs when choosing a
Java-based Subversion implementation.</p>

datatypes.  The call to <code class="function">svn_client_ctx_t()</code> is deceiving
because the public Subversion API has no such function—this just
happens to be a case where SWIG's automatic language generation bleeds
through a little bit (the function is a sort of factory function for
Python's version of the corresponding complex C structure).  Also note that
the path passed to this program (like the last one) gets run through
<code class="function">svn_path_canonicalize()</code>, because to
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> do so runs the risk of triggering the underlying
Subversion C library's assertions about such things, which translates into
rather immediate and unceremonious program abortion.</p>
