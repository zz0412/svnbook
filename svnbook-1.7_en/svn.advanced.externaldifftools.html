        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way
      differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only
      contextual differencing capabilities were built around
      invocations of the GNU diffutils toolchain, specifically the
      <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>diff3</strong></span> utilities.
      To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it called these
      utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters,
      most of which were quite specific to the utilities.  Some time
      later, Subversion grew its own internal differencing library,
      and as a failover mechanism, the <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and
      <code class="option">--diff3-cmd</code> options were added to the
      Subversion command-line client so that users could more easily
      indicate that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3
      utilities instead of the newfangled internal diff library.  If
      those options were used, Subversion would simply ignore the
      internal diff library, and fall back to running those external
      programs, lengthy argument lists and all.  And that's where
      things remain today.</p>
      <p>It didn't take long for folks to realize that having such
      easy configuration mechanisms for specifying that Subversion
      should use the external GNU diff and diff3 utilities located at
      a particular place on the system could be applied toward the use
      of other differencing tools, too.  After all, Subversion didn't
      actually verify that the things it was being told to run were
      members of the GNU diffutils toolchain.  But the only
      configurable aspect of using those external tools is their
      location on the system—not the option set, parameter
      order, and so on.  Subversion continues to throw all those GNU utility
      options at your external diff tool regardless of whether
      that program can understand those options.  And that's where
      things get unintuitive for most users.</p>

              <p>The decision on when to fire off a contextual two- or three-way
        diff as part of a larger Subversion operation is made entirely
        by Subversion and is affected by, among other things, whether
        the files being operated on are human-readable as
        determined by their <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property.
        This means, for example, that even if you had the niftiest
        Microsoft Word-aware differencing or merging tool in the
        universe, it would never be invoked by Subversion as long as
        your versioned Word documents had a configured MIME type that
        denoted that they were not human-readable (such as
        <code class="literal">application/msword</code>).  For more about MIME
        type settings, see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called “File Content Type”</a></p>

      <p>Much later, Subversion 1.5 introduced interactive resolution
      of conflicts (described in
      <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="Resolve Any Conflicts">the section called “Resolve Any Conflicts”</a>).  One of the options
      that this feature provides to users is the ability to
      interactively launch a third-party merge tool.  If this action
      is taken, Subversion will check to see if the user has specified
      such a tool for use in this way.  Subversion will first check
      the <code class="literal">SVN_MERGE</code> environment variable for the
      name of an external merge tool.  If that variable is not set, it
      will look for the same information in the value of
      the <code class="literal">merge-tool-cmd</code> runtime configuration
      option.  Upon finding a configured external merge tool, it will
      invoke that tool.</p>

              <p>While the general purposes of the three-way differencing
        and merge tools are roughly the same (finding a way to make
        separate-but-overlapping file changes live in harmony),
        Subversion exercises each of these options at different times
        and for different reasons.  The internal three-way
        differencing engine and its optional external replacement are
        used when interaction with the user
        is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> expected.  In fact, significant
        delay introduced by such a tool can actually result in the
        failure of some time-sensitive Subversion operations.  It's
        the external merge tool that is intended to be invoked
        interactively.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Now, while the interface between Subversion and an external
      merge tool is significantly less convoluted than that between
      Subversion and the diff and diff3 tools, the likelihood of
      finding such a tool whose calling conventions exactly match what
      Subversion expects is still quite low.  The key to using
      external differencing and merge tools with Subversion is to use
      wrapper scripts, which convert the input from Subversion into
      something that your specific differencing tool can understand,
      and then convert the output of your tool back into a format that
      Subversion expects.  The following sections cover the specifics
      of those expectations.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="External diff">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.externaldifftools.diff"></a>External diff</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion calls external diff programs with parameters
        suitable for the GNU diff utility, and expects only that the
        external program will return with a successful error code per
        the GNU diff definition thereof.  For most alternative diff
        programs, only the sixth and seventh arguments—the paths
        of the files that represent the left and right sides of the
        diff, respectively—are of interest.  Note that
        Subversion runs the diff program once per modified file
        covered by the Subversion operation, so if your program runs
        in an asynchronous fashion (or is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>”</span>),
        you might have several instances of it all running
        simultaneously.  Finally, Subversion expects that your program
        return an error code of 1 if your program detected
        differences, or 0 if it did not—any other error code is
        considered a fatal error.<sup>[<a id="idp16705600" href="#ftn.idp16705600" class="footnote">65</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>Subversion invokes three-way differencing programs to
        perform non-interactive merges.  When configured to use an
        external three-way differencing program, it executes that
        program with parameters suitable for the GNU diff3 utility,
        expecting that the external program will return with a
        successful error code and that the full file contents that
        result from the completed merge operation are printed on the
        standard output stream (so that Subversion can redirect them
        into the appropriate version-controlled file).  For most
        alternative merge programs, only the ninth, tenth, and
        eleventh arguments, the paths of the files which represent
        the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mine</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">older</span>”</span>,
        and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">yours</span>”</span> inputs, respectively, are of
        interest.  Note that because Subversion depends on the output
        of your merge program, your wrapper script must not exit
        before that output has been delivered to Subversion.  When it
        finally does exit, it should return an error code of 0 if the
        merge was successful, or 1 if unresolved conflicts remain in
        the output—any other error code is considered a fatal
        error.</p>
