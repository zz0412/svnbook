      <p>So far, we have only talked about conflicts at the level of
      file content.  When you and your collaborators make overlapping
      changes within the same file, Subversion forces you to merge
      those changes before you can commit.<sup>[<a id="idp8197792" href="#ftn.idp8197792" class="footnote">9</a>]</sup></p>
      <p>But what happens if your collaborators move or delete a file
      that you are still working on?  Maybe there was a
      miscommunication, and one person thinks the file should be
      deleted, while another person still wants to commit changes to
      the file.  Or maybe your collaborators did some refactoring,
      renaming files and moving around directories in the process.  If
      you were still working on these files, those modifications may
      need to be applied to the files at their new location.  Such
      conflicts manifest themselves at the directory tree structure
      level rather than at the file content level, and are known
      as <em class="firstterm">tree conflicts</em>.</p>
      <div class="sidebar" title="Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <p class="title">
                <strong>Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6</strong>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Prior to Subversion 1.6, tree conflicts could yield rather
        unexpected results.  For example, if a file was locally
        modified, but had been renamed in the repository,
        running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> would make Subversion
        carry out the following steps:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Check the file to be renamed for local
          modifications.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Delete the file at its old location, and if it
          had local modifications, keep an on-disk copy of the file at
          the old location.  This on-disk copy now appears as an
          unversioned file in the working copy.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Add the file, as it exists in the repository,
          at its new location.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>When this situation arises, there is the possibility that
        the user makes a commit without realizing that local
        modifications have been left in a now-unversioned file in the
        working copy, and have not reached the repository.  This gets
        more and more likely (and tedious) if the number of files
        affected by this problem is large.</p>
        <p>Since Subversion 1.6, this and other similar situations
        are flagged as conflicts in the working copy.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As with textual conflicts, tree conflicts prevent a commit
      from being made from the conflicted state, giving the user the
      opportunity to examine the state of the working copy for
      potential problems arising from the tree conflict, and resolving
      any such problems before committing.</p>

        <p>Suppose a software project you were working on currently
        looked like this:</p>

        <p>Later, in revision 14, your collaborator Harry renames the file
        <code class="filename">bar.c</code> to <code class="filename">baz.c</code>.
        Unfortunately, you don't realize this yet.  As it turns out,
        you are busy in your working copy composing a different set of

        <p>Note how <code class="filename">bar.c</code> is automatically
        scheduled for re-addition in your working copy, which
        simplifies things in case you want to keep the file.</p>
        <p>Because a move in Subversion is implemented as a copy
        operation followed by a delete operation, and these two
        operations cannot be easily related to one another during an
        update, all Subversion can warn you about is an incoming
        delete operation on a locally modified file.  This delete
        operation <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be part of a move, or it
        could be a genuine delete operation.  Determining exactly what
        semantic change was made to the repository is
        important—you want to know just how your own edits fit
        into the overall trajectory of the project.  So read log
        messages, talk to your collaborators, study the line-based
        differences—do whatever you must do—to determine
        your best course of action.</p>
        <p>In this case, Harry's commit log message tells you what

        <p>To resolve this conflict, you must either agree or
        disagree with the move that Harry made.</p>
        <p>If you agree with the move, your <code class="filename">bar.c</code>
        is superfluous.  You'll want to delete it and mark the tree
        conflict as resolved.  But wait:  you made changes to that
        file!  Before deleting <code class="filename">bar.c</code>, you need to
        decide if the changes you made to it need to be applied
        elsewhere, for example to the new <code class="filename">baz.c</code>
        file where all of <code class="filename">bar.c</code>'s code now lives.
        Let's assume that your changes do need to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">follow the
        move</span>”</span>.  Subversion isn't smart enough to do this work
        for you<sup>[<a id="idp8237184" href="#ftn.idp8237184" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup>, so you need to migrate your
        changes manually.</p>
        <p>In our example, you could manually re-make your change
        to <code class="filename">bar.c</code> pretty easily—it was,
        after all, a single-line change.  That's not always the case,
        though, so we'll show a more scalable approach.  We'll first
        use <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> to create a patch file.  Then
        we'll edit the headers of that patch file to point to the new
        name of our renamed file.  Finally, we re-apply the modified
        patch to our working copy.</p>
