      <p><em class="firstterm">Localization</em> is the act of making
      programs behave in a region-specific way.  When a program
      formats numbers or dates in a way specific to your part of the
      world or prints messages (or accepts input) in your native
      language, the program is said to
      be <em class="firstterm">localized</em>.  This section describes
      steps Subversion has made toward localization.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Most modern operating systems have a notion of the
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">current locale</span>”</span>—that is, the region or
        country whose localization conventions are honored.  These
        conventions—typically chosen by some runtime
        configuration mechanism on the computer—affect the way
        in which programs present data to the user, as well as the way
        in which they accept user input.</p>
        <p>On most Unix-like systems, you can check the values of the
        locale-related runtime configuration options by running the
        <span class="command"><strong>locale</strong></span> command:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ locale
LANG=
LC_COLLATE="C"
LC_CTYPE="C"
LC_MESSAGES="C"
LC_MONETARY="C"
LC_NUMERIC="C"
LC_TIME="C"
LC_ALL="C"
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The output is a list of locale-related environment
        variables and their current values.  In this example, the
        variables are all set to the default <code class="literal">C</code>
        locale, but users can set these variables to specific
        country/language code combinations.  For example, if one were
        to set the <code class="literal">LC_TIME</code> variable to
        <code class="literal">fr_CA</code>, programs would know to present
        time and date information formatted according to a
        French-speaking Canadian's expectations.  And if one were to
        set the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable to
        <code class="literal">zh_TW</code>, programs would know to present
        human-readable messages in Traditional Chinese.  Setting the
        <code class="literal">LC_ALL</code> variable has the effect of changing
        every locale variable to the same value.  The value of
        <code class="literal">LANG</code> is used as a default value for any
        locale variable that is unset.  To see the list of available
        locales on a Unix system, run the command <strong class="userinput"><code>locale
        -a</code></strong>.</p>
        <p>On Windows, locale configuration is done via the
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Regional and Language Options</span>”</span> control panel
        item.  There you can view and select the values of individual
        settings from the available locales, and even customize (at a
        sickening level of detail) several of the display formatting
        conventions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Subversion's Use of Locales">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.l10n.svnuse"></a>Subversion's Use of Locales</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Subversion client, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>, honors the
        current locale configuration in two ways.  First, it notices
        the value of the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable and
        attempts to print all messages in the specified language.  For
        example:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE
$ svn help cat
cat: Gibt den Inhalt der angegebenen Dateien oder URLs aus.
Aufruf: cat ZIEL[@REV]...
…
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This behavior works identically on both Unix and Windows
        systems.  Note, though, that while your operating system might
        have support for a certain locale, the Subversion client still
        may not be able to speak the particular language.  In order to
        produce localized messages, human volunteers must provide
        translations for each language.  The translations are written
        using the GNU gettext package, which results in translation
        modules that end with the <code class="filename">.mo</code> filename
        extension.  For example, the German translation file is named
        <code class="filename">de.mo</code>.  These translation files are
        installed somewhere on your system.  On Unix, they typically
        live in <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/</code>, while
        on Windows they're often found in the
        <code class="filename">share\locale\</code> folder in Subversion's
        installation area.  Once installed, a module is named after
        the program for which it provides translations.  For example, the
        <code class="filename">de.mo</code> file may ultimately end up
        installed as
        <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo</code>.
        By browsing the installed <code class="filename">.mo</code> files, you
        can see which languages the Subversion client is able to
        speak.</p>
        <p>The second way in which the locale is honored involves how
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> interprets your input.  The repository
        stores all paths, filenames, and log messages in Unicode,
        encoded as UTF-8.  In that sense, the repository is
        <em class="firstterm">internationalized</em>—that is, the
        repository is ready to accept input in any human language.
        This means, however, that the Subversion client is responsible
        for sending only UTF-8 filenames and log messages into the
        repository.  To do this, it must convert the data
        from the native locale into UTF-8.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose you create a file named
        <code class="filename">caffè.txt</code>, and then when committing the
        file, you write the log message as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Adesso il caffè è
        più forte.</span>”</span>  Both the filename and the log message contain
        non-ASCII characters, but because your locale is set to
        <code class="literal">it_IT</code>, the Subversion client knows to
        interpret them as Italian.  It uses an Italian character set
        to convert the data to UTF-8 before sending it off to the
        repository.</p>
        <p>Note that while the repository demands UTF-8 filenames and
        log messages, it <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span> pay attention
        to file contents.  Subversion treats file contents as opaque
        strings of bytes, and neither client nor server makes an
        attempt to understand the character set or encoding of the
        contents.</p>
        <div class="sidebar" title="Character Set Conversion Errors">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <p class="title">
                  <strong>Character Set Conversion Errors</strong>
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>While using Subversion, you might get hit with an error
          related to character set conversions:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
svn: E000022: Can't convert string from native encoding to 'UTF-8':
…
svn: E000022: Can't convert string from 'UTF-8' to native encoding:
…
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Errors such as this typically occur when the Subversion
          client has received a UTF-8 string from the repository, but
          not all of the characters in that string can be represented
          using the encoding of the current locale.  For example, if
          your locale is <code class="literal">en_US</code> but a collaborator
          has committed a Japanese filename, you're likely to see this
          error when you receive the file during an <span class="command"><strong>svn
          update</strong></span>.</p>
          <p>The solution is either to set your locale to something
          that <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> represent the incoming UTF-8
          data, or to change the filename or log message in the
          repository.  (And don't forget to slap your collaborator's
          hand—projects should decide on common languages ahead of
          time so that all participants are using the same
          locale.)</p>
