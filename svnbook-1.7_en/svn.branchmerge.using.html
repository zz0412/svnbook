      </div>
      <p>At this point, you should understand how each commit creates
      a new state of the filesystem tree (called a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">revision</span>”</span>)
      in the repository.  If you don't, go back and read about revisions in
      <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.revs" title="Revisions">the section called “Revisions”</a>.</p>
      <p>Let's revisit the example from
      <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.html" title="Chapter 1. Fundamental Concepts">Chapter 1, <em>Fundamental Concepts</em></a>.  Remember that you and your
      collaborator, Sally, are sharing a repository that contains two
      projects, <code class="filename">paint</code> and
      <code class="filename">calc</code>.  Notice that in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1" title="Figure 4.2. Starting repository layout">Figure 4.2, “Starting repository layout”</a>, however, each project
      directory now contains subdirectories named
      <code class="filename">trunk</code> and <code class="filename">branches</code>.
      The reason for this will soon become clear.</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <a id="svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1"></a>
        <p class="title">
          <strong>Figure 4.2. Starting repository layout</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="figure-contents">
          <div>
            <img src="images/ch04dia2.png" alt="Starting repository layout" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br class="figure-break" />
      <p>As before, assume that Sally and you both have working
      copies of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">calc</span>”</span> project.  Specifically, you
      each have a working copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.
      All the files for the project are in this subdirectory rather
      than in <code class="filename">/calc</code> itself, because your team has
      decided that <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> is where the
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">main line</span>”</span> of development is going to take
      place.</p>
      <p>Let's say that you've been given the task of implementing a
      large software feature.  It will take a long time to write, and
      will affect all the files in the project.  The immediate problem
      is that you don't want to interfere with Sally, who is in the
      process of fixing small bugs here and there.  She's depending on
      the fact that the latest version of the project (in
      <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>) is always usable.  If you
      start committing your changes bit by bit, you'll surely break
      things for Sally (and other team members as well).</p>
      <p>One strategy is to crawl into a hole: you can stop sharing
      information for a week or two, gutting and reorganizing all the
      files in your private working copy but not committing or
      updating until you're completely finished with your task.  There
      are a number of problems with this, though.  First, it's not
      very safe.  Should something bad happen to your working copy or
      computer, you risk losing all your changes.  Second, it's not
      very flexible.  Unless you manually replicate your changes
      across different working copies or computers, you're stuck trying
      to make your changes in a single working copy.  Similarly, it's
      difficult to share your work-in-progress with anyone else.  A
      common software development <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">best practice</span>”</span> is to
      allow your peers to review your work as you go.  If nobody sees
      your intermediate commits, you lose potential feedback and may
      end up going down the wrong path for weeks before another person
      on your team notices.  Finally, when you're finished with all
      your changes, you might find it very difficult to merge your
      completed work with the rest of the company's main body of code.
      Sally (or others) may have made many other changes in the
      repository that are difficult to incorporate into your working
      copy when you eventually run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> after
      weeks of isolation.</p>
      <p>The better solution is to create your own branch, or line of
      development, in the repository.  This allows you to save your
      not-yet-completed work frequently without interfering with
      others' changes and while still selectively sharing information
      with your collaborators.  You'll see exactly how this works as
      we continue.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="Creating a Branch">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.using.create"></a>Creating a Branch</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Creating a branch is very simple—you make a copy of
        your project tree in the repository using the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        copy</strong></span> command.  Since your project's source code is
        rooted in the <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> directory, it's
        that directory that you'll copy.  Where should the new
        copy live?  Wherever you wish.  The repository location in
        which branches are stashed is left by Subversion as a matter
        of project policy.  Finally, your branch will need a name to
        distinguish it from other branches.  Once again, the name you
        choose is unimportant to Subversion—you can use whatever
        name works best for you and your team.</p>
        <p>Let's assume that your team (like most) has a policy of
        creating branches in the <code class="filename">branches</code>
        directory that is a sibling of the project's trunk
        (the <code class="filename">/calc/branches</code> directory in our
        scenario).  Lacking inspiration, you settle
        on <code class="literal">my-calc-branch</code> as the name you wish to
        give your branch.  This means that you'll create a new
        directory, <code class="filename">/calc/branches/my-calc-branch</code>,
        which begins its life as a copy
        of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.</p>
        <p>You may already have seen <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> used
        to copy one file to another within a working copy.  But it can
        also be used to do a <em class="firstterm">remote
        copy</em>—a copy that immediately results in a
        newly committed repository revision and for which no working
        copy is required at all.  Just copy one URL to another:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
           -m "Creating a private branch of /calc/trunk."

Committed revision 341.
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This command causes a near-instantaneous commit in the
        repository, creating a new directory in revision 341.  The new
        directory is a copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  This
        is shown in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.create.dia-1" title="Figure 4.3. Repository with new copy">Figure 4.3, “Repository with new copy”</a>.<sup>[<a id="idp10989312" href="#ftn.idp10989312" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup>  While
        it's also possible to create a branch by using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        copy</strong></span> to duplicate a directory within the working
        copy, this technique isn't recommended.  It can be quite slow,
        in fact!  Copying a directory on the client side is a
        linear-time operation, in that it actually has to duplicate
        every file and subdirectory within that working copy directory
        on the local disk.  Copying a directory on the server,
        however, is a constant-time operation, and it's the way most
        people create branches.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Subversion's repository has a special design.  When you
          copy a directory, you don't need to worry about the
          repository growing huge—Subversion doesn't actually
          duplicate any data.  Instead, it creates a new directory
          entry that points to an <span class="emphasis"><em>existing</em></span> tree.
          If you're an experienced Unix user, you'll recognize this as
          the same concept behind a hard link.  As further changes are
          made to files and directories beneath the copied directory,
          Subversion continues to employ this hard link concept where
          it can.  It duplicates data only when it is necessary to
          disambiguate different versions of objects.</p>
          <p>This is why you'll often hear Subversion users talk
          about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cheap copies.</span>”</span>  It doesn't matter how
          large the directory is—it takes a very tiny, constant
          amount of time and space to make a copy of it.  In fact,
          this feature is the basis of how commits work in Subversion:
          each revision is a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cheap copy</span>”</span> of the previous
          revision, with a few items lazily changed within.  (To read
          more about this, visit Subversion's web site and read about
          the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bubble up</span>”</span> method in Subversion's design
          documents.)</p>
          <p>Of course, these internal mechanics of copying and
          sharing data are hidden from the user, who simply sees
          copies of trees.  The main point here is that copies are
          cheap, both in time and in space.  If you create a branch
          entirely within the repository (by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy
          <em class="replaceable"><code>URL1</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>URL2</code></em></code></strong>),
          it's a quick, constant-time operation.  Make branches as
          often as you want.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Working with Your Branch">
        <div class="titlepage">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Now that you've created a branch of the project, you can
        check out a new working copy to start using it:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
A  my-calc-branch/Makefile
A  my-calc-branch/integer.c
A  my-calc-branch/button.c
Checked out revision 341.
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>There's nothing special about this working copy; it simply
        mirrors a different directory in the repository.  When you
        commit changes, however, Sally won't see them when she
        updates, because her working copy is of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  (Be sure to read <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.switchwc.html" title="Traversing Branches">the section called “Traversing Branches”</a> later in this chapter: the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command is an alternative way of
        creating a working copy of a branch.)</p>
        <p>Let's pretend that a week goes by, and the following
        commits happen:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

        these two commits affected different files in different

        <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> show that the two files share a
        common history.  Before the branch copy was made in revision
        341, the files used to be the same file.  That's why you and

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>You should remember two important lessons
        from this section.  First, Subversion has no internal concept
        of a branch—it knows only how to make copies.  When you
        copy a directory, the resultant directory is only
        a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">branch</span>”</span> because <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>
        attach that meaning to it.  You may think of the directory
        differently, or treat it differently, but to Subversion it's
        just an ordinary directory that happens to carry some extra
        historical information.</p>
        <p>Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's
        branches exist as <span class="emphasis"><em>normal filesystem
        directories</em></span> in the repository.  This is different
        from other version control systems, where branches are
        typically defined by adding
        extra-dimensional <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">labels</span>”</span> to collections of
        files.  The location of your branch directory doesn't matter
        to Subversion.  Most teams follow a convention of putting all
        branches into a <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, but
        you're free to invent any policy you wish.</p>
