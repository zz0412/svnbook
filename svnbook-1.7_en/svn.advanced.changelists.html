      <p>It is commonplace for a developer to find himself working at
      any given time on multiple different, distinct changes to a
      particular bit of source code.  This isn't necessarily due to
      poor planning or some form of digital masochism.  A software
      engineer often spots bugs in his peripheral vision while working
      on some nearby chunk of source code.  Or perhaps he's halfway
      through some large change when he realizes the solution he's
      working on is best committed as several smaller logical units.
      Often, these logical units aren't nicely contained in some
      module, safely separated from other changes.  The units might
      overlap, modifying different files in the same module, or even
      modifying different lines in the same file.</p>
      <p>Developers can employ various work methodologies
      to keep these logical changes organized.  Some use
      separate working copies of the same repository to hold each
      individual change in progress.  Others might choose to create
      short-lived feature branches in the repository and use a single
      working copy that is constantly switched to point to one such
      branch or another.  Still others use <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> tools to back up and restore uncommitted
      changes to and from patch files associated with each change.
      Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and to a large
      degree, the details of the changes being made heavily influence
      the methodology used to distinguish them.</p>
      <p>Subversion provides a <em class="firstterm">changelists</em>
      feature that adds yet another method to the mix.  Changelists
      are basically arbitrary labels (currently at most one per file)
      applied to working copy files for the express purpose of
      associating multiple files together.  Users of many of Google's
      software offerings are familiar with this concept already.  For
      example, <a class="ulink" href="http://mail.google.com/" target="_top">Gmail</a>
      doesn't provide the traditional folders-based email organization
      mechanism.  In Gmail, you apply arbitrary labels to emails, and
      multiple emails can be said to be part of the same group if they
      happen to share a particular label.  Viewing only a group of
      similarly labeled emails then becomes a simple user interface
      trick.  Many other Web 2.0 sites have similar
      mechanisms—consider the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tags</span>”</span> used by sites
      such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_top">YouTube</a> and
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_top">Flickr</a>,
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">categories</span>”</span> applied to blog posts, and so on.
      Folks understand today that organization of data is critical,
      but that how that data is organized needs to be a flexible
      concept.  The old files-and-folders paradigm is too rigid for
      some applications.</p>
      <p>Subversion's changelist support allows you to create
      changelists by applying labels to files you want to be
      associated with that changelist, remove those labels, and limit
      the scope of the files on which its subcommands operate to only
      those bearing a particular label.  In this section, we'll look
      in detail at how to do these things.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="Creating and Modifying Changelists">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.changelists.creating"></a>Creating and Modifying Changelists</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>You can create, modify, and delete changelists using the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn changelist</strong></span> command.  More accurately,
        you use this command to set or unset the changelist
        association of a particular working copy file.  A changelist
        is effectively created the first time you label a file with
        that changelist; it is deleted when you remove that label from
        the last file that had it.  Let's examine a usage scenario
        that demonstrates these concepts.</p>
        <p>Harry is fixing some bugs in the calculator application's
        mathematics logic.  His work leads him to change a couple of
        files:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>While testing his bug fix, Harry notices that his changes
        bring to light a tangentially related bug in the user
        interface logic found in <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  Harry
        decides that he'll go ahead and fix that bug, too, as a
        separate commit from his math fixes.  Now, in a small working
        copy with only a handful of files and few logical changes,
        Harry can probably keep his two logical change groupings
        mentally organized without any problem.  But today he's going
        to use Subversion's changelists feature as a special favor to
        the authors of this book.</p>
        <p>Harry first creates a changelist and associates with it
        the two files he's already changed.  He does this by using the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn changelist</strong></span> command to assign the same
        arbitrary changelist name to those files:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-fixes integer.c mathops.c
A [math-fixes] integer.c
A [math-fixes] mathops.c
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see, the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
        status</strong></span> reflects this new grouping.</p>
        <p>Harry now sets off to fix the secondary UI problem.  Since
        he knows which file he'll be changing, he assigns that path to
        a changelist, too.  Unfortunately, Harry carelessly assigns this
        third file to the same changelist as the previous two files:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-fixes button.c
A [math-fixes] button.c
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
        button.c
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Fortunately, Harry catches his mistake.  At this point, he
        has two options.  He can remove the changelist association
        from <code class="filename">button.c</code>, and then assign a
        different changelist name:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist --remove button.c
D [math-fixes] button.c
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
A [ui-fix] button.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Or, he can skip the removal and just assign a new
        changelist name.  In this case, Subversion will first warn
        Harry that <code class="filename">button.c</code> is being removed from
        the first changelist:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
D [math-fixes] button.c
A [ui-fix] button.c
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
        button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Harry now has two distinct changelists present in his
        working copy, and <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> will group its
        output according to these changelist determinations.  Notice
        that even though Harry hasn't yet modified
        <code class="filename">button.c</code>, it still shows up in the output
        of <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> as interesting because it has
        a changelist assignment.  Changelists can be added to and
        removed from files at any time, regardless of whether they
        contain local modifications.</p>
        <p>Harry now fixes the user interface problem in
        <code class="filename">button.c</code>.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
M       button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Changelists As Operation Filters">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.changelists.asfilters"></a>Changelists As Operation Filters</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The visual grouping that Harry sees in the output of
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> as shown in our previous section
        is nice, but not entirely useful.  The
        <span class="command"><strong>status</strong></span> command is but one of many
        operations that he might wish to perform on his working copy.
        Fortunately, many of Subversion's other operations understand
        how to operate on changelists via the use of the
        <code class="option">--changelist</code> option.</p>
        <p>When provided with a <code class="option">--changelist</code> option,
        Subversion commands will limit the scope of their operation to
        only those files to which a particular changelist name is
        assigned.  If Harry now wants to see the actual changes he's
        made to the files in his <code class="literal">math-fixes</code>
        changelist, he <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> explicitly list only
        the files that make up that changelist on the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff</strong></span> command line.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn diff integer.c mathops.c
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c	(revision 1157)
+++ integer.c	(working copy)
…
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
…
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>That works okay for a few files, but what if Harry's
        change touched 20 or 30 files?  That would be an annoyingly
        long list of explicitly named files.  Now that he's using
        changelists, though, Harry can avoid explicitly listing the
        set of files in his changelist from now on, and instead
        provide just the changelist name:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn diff --changelist math-fixes
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c	(revision 1157)
+++ integer.c	(working copy)
…
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
…
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>And when it's time to commit, Harry can again use the
        <code class="option">--changelist</code> option to limit the scope of the
        commit to files in a certain changelist.  He might commit his
        user interface fix by doing the following:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Fix a UI bug found while working on math logic." \
             --changelist ui-fix
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1158.
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In fact, the <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command
        provides a second changelists-related option:
        <code class="option">--keep-changelists</code>.  Normally, changelist
        assignments are removed from files after they are committed.
        But if <code class="option">--keep-changelists</code> is provided,
        Subversion will leave the changelist assignment on the
        committed (and now unmodified) files.  In any case, committing
        files assigned to one changelist leaves other changelists
        undisturbed.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
          <table border="0" summary="Note">
            <tr>
              <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">

              </td>
              <th align="left">Note</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td align="left" valign="top">
                <p>The <code class="option">--changelist</code> option acts only as a
          filter for Subversion command targets, and will not add
          targets to an operation.  For example, on a commit operation
          specified as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn commit /path/to/dir</code></strong>, the
          target is the directory <code class="filename">/path/to/dir</code>
          and its children (to infinite depth).  If you then add a
          changelist specifier to that command, only those files in
          and under <code class="filename">/path/to/dir</code> that are
          assigned that changelist name will be considered as targets
          of the commit—the commit will not include files
          located elsewhere (such as in
          <code class="filename">/path/to/another-dir</code>), regardless of
          their changelist assignment, even if they are part of the
          same working copy as the operation's target(s).</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>Even the <span class="command"><strong>svn changelist</strong></span> command accepts
        the <code class="option">--changelist</code> option.  This allows you to
        quickly and easily rename or remove a changelist:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-bugs --changelist math-fixes --depth infinity .
D [math-fixes] integer.c
A [math-bugs] integer.c
D [math-fixes] mathops.c
A [math-bugs] mathops.c
$ svn changelist --remove --changelist math-bugs --depth infinity .
D [math-bugs] integer.c
D [math-bugs] mathops.c
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Finally, you can specify multiple instances of the
        <code class="option">--changelist</code> option on a single command
        line.  Doing so limits the operation you are performing to
        files found in any of the specified changesets.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Changelist Limitations">
        <div class="titlepage">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion's changelist feature is a handy tool for
        grouping working copy files, but it does have a few limitations.
        Changelists are artifacts of a particular working copy, which
        means that changelist assignments cannot be propagated to the
        repository or otherwise shared with other users.  Changelists
        can be assigned only to files—Subversion doesn't
        currently support the use of changelists with directories.
        Finally, you can have at most one changelist assignment on a
        given working copy file.  Here is where the blog post category
        and photo service tag analogies break down—if you find
        yourself needing to assign a file to multiple changelists,
        you're out of luck.</p>
