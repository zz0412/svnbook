      <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program is a lightweight
      server, capable of speaking to clients over TCP/IP using a
      custom, stateful protocol.  Clients contact an
      <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server by using URLs that begin with
      the <code class="literal">svn://</code> or <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>
      scheme.  This section will explain the different ways of running
      <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, how clients authenticate themselves
      to the server, and how to configure appropriate access control
      to your repositories.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The following sections will cover in detail these various
        deployment options for <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="svnserve as daemon">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.daemon"></a>svnserve as daemon</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The easiest option is to run <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          as a standalone <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">daemon</span>”</span> process.  Use the
          <code class="option">-d</code> option for this:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svnserve -d
$               # svnserve is now running, listening on port 3690
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>When running <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> in daemon mode,
          you can use the <code class="option">--listen-port</code> and
          <code class="option">--listen-host</code> options to customize the
          exact port and hostname to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bind</span>”</span> to.</p>
          <p>Once we successfully start <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          as explained previously, it makes every repository on your
          system available to the network.  A client needs to specify
          an <span class="emphasis"><em>absolute</em></span> path in the repository URL.
          For example, if a repository is located at
          <code class="filename">/var/svn/project1</code>, a client would reach
          it via <code class="uri">svn://host.example.com/var/svn/project1</code>.
          To increase security, you can pass the <code class="option">-r</code>
          option to <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, which restricts it to
          exporting only repositories below that path.  For
          example:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svnserve -d -r /var/svn
…
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Using the <code class="option">-r</code> option effectively
          modifies the location that the program treats as the root of
          the remote filesystem space.  Clients then use URLs that
          have that path portion removed from them, leaving much
          shorter (and much less revealing) URLs:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout svn://host.example.com/project1
…
</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" title="svnserve via inetd">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.inetd"></a>svnserve via inetd</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>If you want <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> to launch the
          process, you need to pass the <code class="option">-i</code>
          (<code class="option">--inetd</code>) option.  In the following
          example, we've shown the output from running
          <code class="literal">svnserve -i</code> at the command line, but note
          that this isn't how you actually start the daemon; see the
          paragraphs following the example for how to configure
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> to start
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svnserve -i
( success ( 2 2 ( ) ( edit-pipeline svndiff1 absent-entries commit-revprops d\
epth log-revprops atomic-revprops partial-replay ) ) )
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>When invoked with the <code class="option">--inetd</code> option,
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> attempts to speak with a
          Subversion client via <code class="filename">stdin</code> and
          <code class="filename">stdout</code> using a custom protocol.  This
          is the standard behavior for a program being run via
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span>.  The IANA has reserved port 3690
          for the Subversion protocol, so on a Unix-like system you
          can add lines to <code class="filename">/etc/services</code> such as
          these (if they don't already exist):</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
svn           3690/tcp   # Subversion
svn           3690/udp   # Subversion
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>If your system is using a classic Unix-like
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> daemon, you can add this line to
          <code class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</code>:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
svn stream tcp nowait svnowner /usr/bin/svnserve svnserve -i
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Make sure <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">svnowner</span>”</span> is a user that has
          appropriate permissions to access your repositories.  Now,
          when a client connection comes into your server on port
          3690, <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> will spawn an
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process to service it.  Of
          course, you may also want to add <code class="option">-r</code> to the
          configuration line as well, to restrict which repositories
          are exported.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" title="svnserve over a tunnel">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.tunnel"></a>svnserve over a tunnel</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Another way to invoke <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> is in
          tunnel mode, using the <code class="option">-t</code> option.  This
          mode assumes that a remote-service program such as
          <span class="command"><strong>rsh</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> has
          successfully authenticated a user and is now invoking a
          private <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process <span class="emphasis"><em>as
          that user</em></span>.  (Note that you, the user, will
          rarely, if ever, have reason to invoke
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> with the <code class="option">-t</code> at
          the command line; instead, the SSH daemon
          does so for you.)  The <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program
          behaves normally (communicating via
          <code class="filename">stdin</code> and <code class="filename">stdout</code>)
          and assumes that the traffic is being automatically
          redirected over some sort of tunnel back to the client.
          When <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> is invoked by a tunnel
          agent like this, be sure that the authenticated user has
          full read and write access to the repository database files.
          It's essentially the same as a local user accessing the
          repository via <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs.</p>
          <p>This option is described in much more detail later in
          this chapter in <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshauth" title="Tunneling over SSH">the section called “Tunneling over SSH”</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" title="svnserve as a Windows service">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.winservice"></a>svnserve as a Windows service</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>If your Windows system is a descendant of Windows NT
          (Windows 2000 or newer), you can
          run <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as a standard Windows
          service.  This is typically a much nicer experience than
          running it as a standalone daemon with
          the <code class="option">--daemon</code> (<code class="option">-d</code>) option.
          Using daemon mode requires launching a console, typing a
          command, and then leaving the console window running
          indefinitely.  A Windows service, however, runs in the
          background, can start at boot time automatically, and can be
          started and stopped using the same consistent administration
          interface as other Windows services.</p>
          <p>You'll need to define the new service using the
          command-line tool <span class="command"><strong>SC.EXE</strong></span>.  Much like
          the <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> configuration line, you must
          specify an exact invocation of <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          for Windows to run at startup time:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "C:\svn\bin\svnserve.exe --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>This defines a new Windows service named
          <code class="literal">svn</code> which executes a particular
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve.exe</strong></span> command when started (in
          this case, rooted at <code class="filename">C:\repos</code>).  There
          are a number of caveats in the prior example,
          however.</p>
          <p>First, notice that the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve.exe</strong></span>
          program must always be invoked with the
          <code class="option">--service</code> option.  Any other options to
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> must then be specified on the
          same line, but you cannot add conflicting options such as
          <code class="option">--daemon</code>
          (<code class="option">-d</code>), <code class="option">--tunnel</code>,
          or <code class="option">--inetd</code> (<code class="option">-i</code>).  Options
          such as <code class="option">-r</code>
          or <code class="option">--listen-port</code> are fine, though.  Second,
          be careful about spaces when invoking
          the <span class="command"><strong>SC.EXE</strong></span> command: the <code class="literal">key=
          value</code> patterns must have no spaces between
          <code class="literal">key=</code> and must have exactly one space
          before the <code class="literal">value</code>.  Lastly, be careful
          about spaces in your command line to be invoked.  If a
          directory name contains spaces (or other characters that
          need escaping), place the entire inner value of
          <code class="literal">binpath</code> in double quotes, by escaping
          them:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "\"C:\program files\svn\bin\svnserve.exe\" --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Also note that the word <code class="literal">binpath</code> is
          misleading—its value is a <span class="emphasis"><em>command
          line</em></span>, not the path to an executable.  That's why
          you need to surround it with quotes if it contains
          embedded spaces.</p>
          <p>Once the service is defined, it can be stopped, started,
          or queried using standard GUI tools (the Services
          administrative control panel), or at the command
          line:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
C:\&gt; net stop svn
C:\&gt; net start svn
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The service can also be uninstalled (i.e., undefined) by
          deleting its definition:  <strong class="userinput"><code>sc delete svn</code></strong>.
          Just be sure to stop the service first!
          The <span class="command"><strong>SC.EXE</strong></span> program has many other
          subcommands and options; run <strong class="userinput"><code>sc /?</code></strong> to
          learn more about it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" title="svnserve as a launchd job">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Mac OS X (10.4 and higher) uses <span class="command"><strong>launchd</strong></span>
          to manage processes (including daemons) both system-wide and
          per-user.  A <span class="command"><strong>launchd</strong></span> job is specified by
          parameters in an XML property list file, and
          the <span class="command"><strong>launchctl</strong></span> command is used to manage
          the lifecycle of those jobs.</p>
          <p>When configured to run as a <span class="command"><strong>launchd</strong></span>
          job, <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> is automatically launched
          on demand whenever incoming Subversion
          <code class="literal">svn://</code> network traffic needs to be
          handled.  This is far more convenient than a configuration
          which requires you to manually invoke
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as a long-running
          background process.</p>
          <p>To configure <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as
          a <span class="command"><strong>launchd</strong></span> job, first create a job
          definition file named

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server, by default, knows
        only how to send a CRAM-MD5<sup>[<a id="idp14575904" href="#ftn.idp14575904" class="footnote">52</a>]</sup> authentication challenge.  In essence,
        the server sends a small amount of data to the client.  The
        client uses the MD5 hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of
        the data and password combined, and then sends the fingerprint
        as a response.  The server performs the same computation with
        the stored password to verify that the result is identical.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>At no point does the actual password travel over the
        network.</em></span></p>
        <p>If your <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server was built with
        SASL support, it not only knows how to send CRAM-MD5 challenges,
        but also likely knows a whole host of other authentication
        mechanisms.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl" title="Using svnserve with SASL">the section called “Using <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> with SASL”</a> later in this
        chapter to learn how to configure SASL authentication and
        encryption.</p>
        <p>It's also possible, of course, for the client to be
        externally authenticated via a tunnel agent, such as
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>.  In that case, the server simply
        examines the user it's running as, and uses this name as the
        authenticated username.  For more on this, see the later
        section, <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshauth" title="Tunneling over SSH">the section called “Tunneling over SSH”</a>.</p>
        <p>As you've already guessed, a repository's
        <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file is the central
        mechanism for controlling authentication and authorization
        policies.  The file has the same format as other configuration
        files (see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.confarea.html" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called “Runtime Configuration Area”</a>):
        section names are marked by square brackets
        (<code class="literal">[</code> and <code class="literal">]</code>), comments
        begin with hashes (<code class="literal">#</code>), and each section
        contains specific variables that can be set (<code class="literal">variable
        = value</code>).  Let's walk through these files and learn
        how to use them.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Create a users file and realm">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth.users"></a>Create a users file and realm</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>For now, the <code class="literal">[general]</code> section of
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> has all the variables you
          need.  Begin by changing the values of those variables:
          choose a name for a file that will contain your usernames
          and passwords and choose an authentication realm:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The <code class="literal">realm</code> is a name that you define.
          It tells clients which sort of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">authentication
          namespace</span>”</span> they're connecting to; the Subversion
          client displays it in the authentication prompt and uses it
          as a key (along with the server's hostname and port) for
          caching credentials on disk (see <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="Caching credentials">the section called “Caching credentials”</a>).  The
          <code class="literal">password-db</code> variable points to a separate
          file that contains a list of usernames and passwords, using
          the same familiar format.  For example:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
[users]
harry = foopassword
sally = barpassword
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The value of <code class="literal">password-db</code> can be an
          absolute or relative path to the users file.  For many
          admins, it's easy to keep the file right in the
          <code class="filename">conf/</code> area of the repository, alongside
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code>.  On the other hand, it's
          possible you may want to have two or more repositories share
          the same users file; in that case, the file should probably
          live in a more public place.  The repositories sharing the
          users file should also be configured to have the same realm,
          since the list of users essentially defines an
          authentication realm.  Wherever the file lives, be sure to
          set the file's read and write permissions appropriately.  If
          you know which user(s) <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> will run
          as, restrict read access to the users file as necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" title="Set access controls">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth.general"></a>Set access controls</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>There are two more variables to set in the
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file: they determine what
          unauthenticated (anonymous) and authenticated users are
          allowed to do.  The variables <code class="literal">anon-access</code>
          and <code class="literal">auth-access</code> can be set to the value
          <code class="literal">none</code>, <code class="literal">read</code>, or
          <code class="literal">write</code>.  Setting the value to
          <code class="literal">none</code> prohibits both reading and writing;
          <code class="literal">read</code> allows read-only access to the
          repository, and <code class="literal">write</code> allows complete
          read/write access to the repository.  For example:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users can only read the repository
anon-access = read

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The example settings are, in fact, the default values of
          the variables, should you forget to define them.  If you
          want to be even more conservative, you can block anonymous
          access completely:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users aren't allowed
anon-access = none

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The server process understands not only
          these <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">blanket</span>”</span> access controls to the
          repository, but also finer-grained access restrictions
          placed on specific files and directories within the
          repository.  To make use of this feature, you need to define
          a file containing more detailed rules, and then set
          the <code class="literal">authz-db</code> variable to point to
          it:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# Specific access rules for specific locations
authz-db = authzfile
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>We discuss the syntax of the <code class="filename">authzfile</code> file
          in detail later in this chapter, in
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html" title="Path-Based Authorization">the section called “Path-Based Authorization”</a>.  Note
          that the <code class="literal">authz-db</code> variable isn't mutually
          exclusive with the <code class="literal">anon-access</code>
          and <code class="literal">auth-access</code> variables;  if all the
          variables are defined at once, <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
          of the rules must be satisfied before access is allowed.</p>

        <p>For many teams, the built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication is
        all they need from <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.  However, if
        your server (and your Subversion clients) were built with the
        Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) library,
        you have a number of authentication and encryption
        options available to you.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer is
          open source software written by Carnegie Mellon University.
          It adds generic authentication and encryption capabilities
          to any network protocol, and as of Subversion 1.5 and later,
          both the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server
          and <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> client know how to make use of
          this library.  It may or may not be available to you: if
          you're building Subversion yourself, you'll need to have at
          least version 2.1 of SASL installed on your system, and
          you'll need to make sure that it's detected during
          Subversion's build process.  The Subversion command-line
          client will report the availability of Cyrus SASL when you
          run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn --version</code></strong>; if you're using
          some other Subversion client, you might need to check with
          the package maintainer as to whether SASL support was
          compiled in.</p>
          <p>SASL comes with a number of pluggable modules that
          represent different authentication systems: Kerberos
          (GSSAPI), NTLM, One-Time-Passwords (OTP), DIGEST-MD5, LDAP,
          Secure-Remote-Password (SRP), and others.  Certain
          mechanisms may or may not be available to you; be sure to
          check which modules are provided.</p>
          <p>You can download Cyrus SASL (both code and
          documentation) from
          <a class="ulink" href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html" target="_top">http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Normally, when a subversion client connects to
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, the server sends a greeting that
        advertises a list of the capabilities it supports, and the
        client responds with a similar list of capabilities.  If the
        server is configured to require authentication, it then sends
        a challenge that lists the authentication mechanisms
        available; the client responds by choosing one of the
        mechanisms, and then authentication is carried out in some
        number of round-trip messages.  Even when SASL capabilities
        aren't present, the client and server inherently know how to
        use the CRAM-MD5 and ANONYMOUS mechanisms (see
        <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth" title="Built-in Authentication and Authorization">the section called “Built-in Authentication and Authorization”</a>).  If server
        and client were linked against SASL, a number of other
        authentication mechanisms may also be available.  However,
        you'll need to explicitly configure SASL on the server side to
        advertise them.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Authenticating with SASL">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.authn"></a>Authenticating with SASL</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>To activate specific SASL mechanisms on the server,
          you'll need to do two things.  First, create
          a <code class="literal">[sasl]</code> section in your
          repository's <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file with an
          initial key-value pair:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Second, create a main SASL configuration file
          called <code class="filename">svn.conf</code> in a place where the
          SASL library can find it—typically in the directory
          where SASL plug-ins are located.  You'll have to locate the
          plug-in directory on your particular system, such
          as <code class="filename">/usr/lib/sasl2/</code>
          or <code class="filename">/etc/sasl2/</code>.  (Note that this
          is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
          the <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file that lives
          within a repository!)</p>
          <p>On a Windows server, you'll also have to edit the system
          registry (using a tool such as <span class="command"><strong>regedit</strong></span>)
          to tell SASL where to find things.  Create a registry key
          named <code class="literal">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Carnegie
          Mellon\Project Cyrus\SASL Library]</code>, and place two
          keys inside it: a key called <code class="literal">SearchPath</code>
          (whose value is a path to the directory containing the SASL
          <code class="filename">sasl*.dll</code> plug-in libraries), and a key
          called
          <code class="literal">ConfFile</code> (whose value is a path to the
          parent directory containing
          the <code class="filename">svn.conf</code> file you created).</p>
          <p>Because SASL provides so many different kinds of
          authentication mechanisms, it would be foolish (and far
          beyond the scope of this book) to try to describe every
          possible server-side configuration.  Instead, we recommend
          that you read the documentation supplied in the
          <code class="filename">doc/</code> subdirectory of the SASL source
          code.  It goes into great detail about every mechanism and
          how to configure the server appropriately for each.  For the
          purposes of this discussion, we'll just demonstrate a simple
          example of configuring the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism.  For
          example, if your <code class="filename">subversion.conf</code>
          (or <code class="filename">svn.conf</code>) file contains the
          following:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
sasldb_path: /etc/my_sasldb
mech_list: DIGEST-MD5
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>you've told SASL to advertise the DIGEST-MD5
          mechanism to clients and to check user passwords against a
          private password database located
          at <code class="filename">/etc/my_sasldb</code>.  A system
          administrator can then use
          the <span class="command"><strong>saslpasswd2</strong></span> program to add or modify
          usernames and passwords in the database:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ saslpasswd2 -c -f /etc/my_sasldb -u realm username
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>A few words of warning: first, make sure the
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">realm</span>”</span> argument
          to <span class="command"><strong>saslpasswd2</strong></span> matches the same realm
          you've defined in your
          repository's <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file; if
          they don't match, authentication will fail.  Also, due to a
          shortcoming in SASL, the common realm must be a string with
          no space characters.  Finally, if you decide to go with the
          standard SASL password database, make sure
          the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program has read access to
          the file (and possibly write access as well, if you're using
          a mechanism such as OTP).</p>
          <p>This is just one simple way of configuring SASL.  Many
          other authentication mechanisms are available, and passwords
          can be stored in other places such as in LDAP or a SQL
          database.  Consult the full SASL documentation for
          details.</p>
          <p>Remember that if you configure your server to only allow
          certain SASL authentication mechanisms, this forces all
          connecting clients to have SASL support as well.  Any
          Subversion client built without SASL support (which includes
          all pre-1.5 clients) will be unable to authenticate.  On the
          one hand, this sort of restriction may be exactly what you
          want (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">My clients must all use Kerberos!</span>”</span>).
          However, if you still want non-SASL clients to be able to
          authenticate, be sure to advertise the CRAM-MD5 mechanism as
          an option.  All clients are able to use CRAM-MD5, whether
          they have SASL capabilities or not.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" title="SASL encryption">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.encryption"></a>SASL encryption</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>SASL is also able to perform data encryption if a
          particular mechanism supports it.  The built-in CRAM-MD5
          mechanism doesn't support encryption, but DIGEST-MD5 does,
          and mechanisms such as SRP actually require use of the
          OpenSSL library.  To enable or disable different levels of
          encryption, you can set two values in your repository's
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
min-encryption = 128
max-encryption = 256
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The <code class="literal">min-encryption</code> and
          <code class="literal">max-encryption</code> variables control the
          level of encryption demanded by the server.  To disable
          encryption completely, set both values to 0.  To enable
          simple checksumming of data (i.e., prevent tampering and
          guarantee data integrity without encryption), set both
          values to 1.  If you wish to allow—but not
          require—encryption, set the minimum value to 0, and
          the maximum value to some bit length.  To require encryption
          unconditionally, set both values to numbers greater than 1.
          In our previous example, we require clients to do at least
          128-bit encryption, but no more than 256-bit
          encryption.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p><span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>'s built-in authentication (and
        SASL support) can be very handy, because it avoids the need to
        create real system accounts.  On the other hand, some
        administrators already have well-established SSH
        authentication frameworks in place.  In these situations, all
        of the project's users already have system accounts and the
        ability to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">SSH into</span>”</span> the server machine.</p>
        <p>It's easy to use SSH in conjunction with
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.  The client simply uses the
        <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URL scheme to connect:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ whoami
harry

$ svn list svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project
harryssh@host.example.com's password:  *****

foo
bar
baz
…
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In this example, the Subversion client is invoking a local
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> process, connecting to
        <code class="literal">host.example.com</code>, authenticating as the
        user <code class="literal">harryssh</code> (according to SSH user
        configuration), then spawning a private
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process on the remote machine
        running as the user <code class="literal">harryssh</code>.  The
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> command is being invoked in tunnel
        mode (<code class="option">-t</code>), and its network protocol is being
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tunneled</span>”</span> over the encrypted connection by
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>, the tunnel agent.
        If the client performs a commit, the authenticated username
        <code class="literal">harryssh</code> will be used as the author
        of the new revision.</p>
        <p>The important thing to understand here is that the
        Subversion client is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> connecting to a
        running <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> daemon.  This method of
        access doesn't require a daemon, nor does it notice one if
        present.  It relies wholly on the ability of
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> to spawn a temporary
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process, which then terminates
        when the network connection is closed.</p>
        <p>When using <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URLs to access a
        repository, remember that it's the <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>
        program prompting for authentication, and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> client
        program.  That means there's no automatic password-caching
        going on (see <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="Caching credentials">the section called “Caching credentials”</a>).
        The Subversion client often makes multiple connections to the
        repository, though users don't normally notice this due to the
        password caching feature.  When using
        <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URLs, however, users may be
        annoyed by <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> repeatedly asking for a
        password for every outbound connection.  The solution is to
        use a separate SSH password-caching tool such as
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh-agent</strong></span> on a Unix-like system, or
        <span class="command"><strong>pageant</strong></span> on Windows.</p>
        <p>When running over a tunnel, authorization is primarily
        controlled by operating system permissions to the repository's
        database files; it's very much the same as if Harry were
        accessing the repository directly via a
        <code class="literal">file://</code> URL.  If multiple system users are
        going to be accessing the repository directly, you may want to
        place them into a common group, and you'll need to be careful
        about umasks (be sure to read <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.multimethod.html" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called “Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods”</a> later in this
        chapter).  But even in the case of tunneling, you can still use the
        <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file to block access, by
        simply setting <code class="literal">auth-access = read</code>
        or <code class="literal">auth-access = none</code>.<sup>[<a id="idp14694304" href="#ftn.idp14694304" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>You'd think that the story of SSH tunneling would end
        here, but it doesn't.  Subversion allows you to create custom
        tunnel behaviors in your runtime <code class="filename">config</code>
        file (see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.confarea.html" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called “Runtime Configuration Area”</a>).  For
        example, suppose you want to use RSH instead of
        SSH.<sup>[<a id="idp14697584" href="#ftn.idp14697584" class="footnote">54</a>]</sup>  In
        the <code class="literal">[tunnels]</code> section of your
        <code class="filename">config</code> file, simply define it like
        this:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
[tunnels]
rsh = rsh
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>And now, you can use this new tunnel definition by using a
        URL scheme that matches the name of your new variable:
        <code class="literal">svn+rsh://host/path</code>.  When using the new
        URL scheme, the Subversion client will actually be running the
        command <strong class="userinput"><code>rsh host svnserve -t</code></strong> behind the
        scenes.  If you include a username in the URL (e.g.,
        <code class="literal">svn+rsh://username@host/path</code>), the client
        will also include that in its command (<strong class="userinput"><code>rsh
        username@host svnserve -t</code></strong>).  But you can define new
        tunneling schemes to be much more clever than that:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
[tunnels]
joessh = $JOESSH /opt/alternate/ssh -p 29934
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This example demonstrates a couple of things.  First, it
        shows how to make the Subversion client launch a very specific
        tunneling binary (the one located at
        <code class="filename">/opt/alternate/ssh</code>) with specific
        options.  In this case, accessing an
        <code class="literal">svn+joessh://</code> URL would invoke the
        particular SSH binary with <code class="option">-p 29934</code> as
        arguments—useful if you want the tunnel program to
        connect to a nonstandard port.</p>
        <p>Second, it shows how to define a custom environment
        variable that can override the name of the tunneling program.
        Setting the <code class="literal">SVN_SSH</code> environment variable is
        a convenient way to override the default SSH tunnel agent.
        But if you need to have several different overrides for
        different servers, each perhaps contacting a different port or
        passing a different set of options to SSH, you can use the
        mechanism demonstrated in this example.  Now if we were to set
        the <code class="literal">JOESSH</code> environment variable, its value
        would override the entire value of the tunnel
        variable—<span class="command"><strong>$JOESSH</strong></span> would be executed
        instead of <strong class="userinput"><code>/opt/alternate/ssh -p
        29934</code></strong>.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>It's possible to control not only the way in which the
        client invokes <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>, but also to control
        the behavior of <span class="command"><strong>sshd</strong></span> on your server
        machine.  In this section, we'll show how to control the
        exact <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> command executed
        by <span class="command"><strong>sshd</strong></span>, as well as how to have multiple
        users share a single system account.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Initial setup">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>To begin, locate the home directory of the account
          you'll be using to launch <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.  Make
          sure the account has an SSH public/private keypair
          installed, and that the user can log in via public-key
          authentication.  Password authentication will not work,
          since all of the following SSH tricks revolve around using
          the SSH <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code> file.</p>
          <p>If it doesn't already exist, create the
          <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code> file (on Unix,
          typically <code class="filename">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>).
          Each line in this file describes a public key that is
          allowed to connect.  The lines are typically of the
          form:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
  ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch… user@example.com
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The first field describes the type of key, the second
          field is the base64-encoded key itself, and the third field
          is a comment.  However, it's a lesser known fact that the
          entire line can be preceded by a <code class="literal">command</code>
          field:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
  command="program" ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch… user@example.com
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>When the <code class="literal">command</code> field is set, the
          SSH daemon will run the named program instead of the
          typical tunnel-mode <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> invocation that the
          Subversion client asks for.  This opens the door to a number
          of server-side tricks.  In the following examples, we
          abbreviate the lines of the file as:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
  command="program" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</pre>
          </div>

        <div class="sect3" title="Controlling the invoked command">
          <div class="titlepage">

                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.fixedcmd"></a>Controlling the invoked command</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Because we can specify the executed server-side command,
          it's easy to name a specific <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          binary to run and to pass it extra arguments:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
  command="/path/to/svnserve -t -r /virtual/root" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>In this example, <code class="filename">/path/to/svnserve</code>
          might be a custom wrapper script
          around <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> which sets the umask (see
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.multimethod.html" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called “Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods”</a>).  It also
          shows how to anchor <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> in a virtual
          root directory, just as one often does when
          running <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as a daemon process.
          This might be done either to restrict access to parts of the
          system, or simply to relieve the user of having to type an
          absolute path in the <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>
          URL.</p>
          <p>It's also possible to have multiple users share a single
          account.  Instead of creating a separate system account for
          each user, generate a public/private key pair for each
          person.  Then place each public key into
          the <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code> file, one per
          line, and use the <code class="option">--tunnel-user</code>
          option:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry" TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=sally" TYPE2 KEY2 sally@example.com
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>This example allows both Harry and Sally to connect to
          the same account via public key authentication.  Each of
          them has a custom command that will be executed;
          the <code class="option">--tunnel-user</code> option
          tells <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> to assume that the named
          argument is the authenticated user.  Without
          <code class="option">--tunnel-user</code>, it would appear as though
          all commits were coming from the one shared system
          account.</p>
          <p>A final word of caution: giving a user access to the
          server via public-key in a shared account might still allow
          other forms of SSH access, even if you've set
          the <code class="literal">command</code> value
          in <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code>.  For example, the
          user may still get shell access through SSH or be able to
          perform X11 or general port forwarding through your server.
          To give the user as little permission as possible, you may
          want to specify a number of restrictive options immediately
          after the <code class="literal">command</code>:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forw
arding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Note that this all must be on one line—truly on
          one line—since SSH <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code>
          files do not even allow the conventional backslash character
          (<code class="literal">\</code>) for line continuation.  The only
          reason we've shown it with a line break is to fit it on
          the physical page of a book.</p>
