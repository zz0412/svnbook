      <p>A version control system (or revision control system) is a
      system that tracks incremental versions (or revisions) of files
      and, in some cases, directories over time.  Of course, merely
      tracking the various versions of a user's (or group of users')
      files and directories isn't very interesting in itself.  What
      makes a version control system useful is the fact that it allows
      you to explore the changes which resulted in each of those
      versions and facilitates the arbitrary recall of the
      same.</p>
      <p>In this section, we'll introduce some fairly high-level
      version control system components and concepts.  We'll limit our
      discussion to modern version control systems—in today's
      interconnected world, there is very little point in
      acknowledging version control systems which cannot
      operate across wide-area networks.</p>

        <p>At the core of the version control system is a repository,
        which is the central store of that system's data.  The
        repository usually stores information in the form of a
        <em class="firstterm">filesystem tree</em>—a hierarchy of
        files and directories.  Any number of
        <em class="firstterm">clients</em> connect to the repository, and
        then read or write to these files.  By writing data, a client
        makes the information available to others; by reading data,
        the client receives information from others.
        <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.version-control-basics.html#svn.basic.repository.dia-1" title="Figure 1.1. A typical client/server system">Figure 1.1, “A typical client/server system”</a> illustrates
        this.</p>

        <p>Why is this interesting?  So far, this sounds like the
        definition of a typical file server.  And indeed, the
        repository <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a kind of file server, but
        it's not your usual breed.  What makes the repository special
        is that as the files in the repository are changed, the
        repository remembers each version of those files.</p>
        <p>When a client reads data from the repository, it normally
        sees only the latest version of the filesystem tree.  But what
        makes a version control client interesting is that it also has
        the ability to request previous states of the filesystem from
        the repository.  A version control client can ask historical
        questions such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">What did this directory contain last
        Wednesday?</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Who was the last person to
        change this file, and what changes did he make?</span>”</span>
        These are the sorts of questions that are at the heart of any
        version control system.</p>

        <p>A version control system's value comes from the fact that it
        tracks versions of files and directories, but the rest of the
        software universe doesn't operate on <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">versions of files
        and directories</span>”</span>.  Most software programs understand
        how to operate only on a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> version
        of a specific type of file.  So how does a version control
        user interact with an abstract—and, often,
        remote—repository full of multiple versions of various
        files in a concrete fashion?  How does his or her word
        processing software, presentation software, source code
        editor, web design software, or some other program—all
        of which trade in the currency of simple data files—get
        access to such files?  The answer is found in the version
        control construct known as a <em class="firstterm">working
        copy</em>.</p>
        <p>A working copy is, quite literally, a local copy of a
        particular version of a user's VCS-managed data upon which
        that user is free to work.  Working copies<sup>[<a id="idp7112016" href="#ftn.idp7112016" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup> appear to other software
        just as any other local directory full of files, so those
        programs don't have to be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">version-control-aware</span>”</span>
        in order to read from and write to that data.  The task of
        managing the working copy and communicating changes made to
        its contents to and from the repository falls squarely to the
        version control system's client software.</p>

        <p>If the primary mission of a version control system is to
        track the various versions of digital information over time, a
        very close secondary mission in any modern version control
        system is to enable collaborative editing and sharing of that
        data.  But different systems use different strategies to
        achieve this.  It's important to understand these different
        strategies, for a couple of reasons.  First, it will help you
        compare and contrast existing version control systems, in case
        you encounter other systems similar to Subversion.  Beyond
        that, it will also help you make more effective use of
        Subversion, since Subversion itself supports a couple of
        different ways of working.</p>

          </div>
          <p>All version control systems have to solve the same
          fundamental problem: how will the system allow users to
          share information, but prevent them from accidentally
          stepping on each other's feet?  It's all too easy for users
          to accidentally overwrite each other's changes in the
          repository.</p>
          <p>Consider the scenario shown in
          <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.version-control-basics.html#svn.basic.vsn-models.problem-sharing.dia-1" title="Figure 1.2. The problem to avoid">Figure 1.2, “The problem to avoid”</a>.
          Suppose we have two coworkers, Harry and Sally.  They each
          decide to edit the same repository file at the same time.
          If Harry saves his changes to the repository first, it's
          possible that (a few moments later) Sally could accidentally
          overwrite them with her own new version of the file.  While
          Harry's version of the file won't be lost forever (because
          the system remembers every change), any changes Harry made
          <span class="emphasis"><em>won't</em></span> be present in Sally's newer version
          of the file, because she never saw Harry's changes to begin
          with.  Harry's work is still effectively lost—or at
          least missing from the latest version of the file—and
          probably by accident.  This is definitely a situation we want
          to avoid!</p>

          <p>Many version control systems use a
          <em class="firstterm">lock-modify-unlock</em> model to address
          the problem of many authors clobbering each other's work.
          In this model, the repository allows only one person to
          change a file at a time.  This exclusivity policy is managed
          using locks.  Harry must <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">lock</span>”</span> a file before
          he can begin making changes to it.  If Harry has locked a
          file, Sally cannot also lock it, and therefore cannot make
          any changes to that file.  All she can do is read the file
          and wait for Harry to finish his changes and release his
          lock.  After Harry unlocks the file, Sally can take her turn
          by locking and editing the file.

          <p>The problem with the lock-modify-unlock model is that it's
          a bit restrictive and often becomes a roadblock for
          users:</p>

              problems.</em></span>

              Sometimes Harry will lock a file and then forget about it.
              Meanwhile, because Sally is still waiting to edit the file,
              her hands are tied.  And then Harry goes on vacation.  Now
              Sally has to get an administrator to release Harry's lock.
              The situation ends up causing a lot of unnecessary delay
              and wasted time.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Locking may cause unnecessary
              serialization.</em></span>

              What if Harry is editing the beginning of a text file,
              and Sally simply wants to edit the end of the same file?
              These changes don't overlap at all.  They could easily
              edit the file simultaneously, and no great harm would
              come, assuming the changes were properly merged together.
              There's no need for them to take turns in this
              situation.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Locking may create a false sense of
              security.</em></span>

              Suppose Harry locks and edits file A, while Sally
              simultaneously locks and edits file B.  But what if A and
              B depend on one another, and the changes made to each are
              semantically incompatible?  Suddenly A and B don't work
              together anymore.  The locking system was powerless to
              prevent the problem—yet it somehow provided a false
              sense of security.  It's easy for Harry and Sally to
              imagine that by locking files, each is beginning a safe,
              insulated task, and thus they need not bother discussing
              their incompatible changes early on.  Locking often
              becomes a substitute for real communication.</p>

          <p>Subversion, CVS, and many other version control systems
          use a <em class="firstterm">copy-modify-merge</em> model as an
          alternative to locking.  In this model, each user's client
          contacts the project repository and creates a personal
          working copy.  Users then work simultaneously and
          independently, modifying their private copies.  Finally, the
          private copies are merged together into a new, final
          version.  The version control system often assists with the
          merging, but ultimately, a human being is responsible for
          making it happen correctly.</p>
          <p>Here's an example.  Say that Harry and Sally each create
          working copies of the same project, copied from the
          repository.  They work concurrently and make changes to the
          same file A within their copies.  Sally saves her changes to
          the repository first.  When Harry attempts to save his changes
          later, the repository informs him that his file A is
          <em class="firstterm">out of date</em>.  In other words, file A
          in the repository has somehow changed since he last copied
          it.  So Harry asks his client
          to <em class="firstterm">merge</em> any new changes from the
          repository into his working copy of file A.  Chances are
          that Sally's changes don't overlap with his own; once he has
          both sets of changes integrated, he saves his working copy
          back to the repository.

          <p>But what if Sally's changes <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> overlap
          with Harry's changes?  What then?  This situation is called a
          <em class="firstterm">conflict</em>, and it's usually not much
          of a problem.  When Harry asks his client to merge the
          latest repository changes into his working copy, his copy of
          file A is somehow flagged as being in a state of conflict:
          he'll be able to see both sets of conflicting changes and
          manually choose between them.  Note that software can't
          automatically resolve conflicts; only humans are capable of
          understanding and making the necessary intelligent choices.
          Once Harry has manually resolved the overlapping
          changes—perhaps after a discussion with Sally—he
          can safely save the merged file back to the
          repository.</p>
          <p>The copy-modify-merge model may sound a bit chaotic, but
          in practice, it runs extremely smoothly.  Users can work in
          parallel, never waiting for one another.  When they work on
          the same files, it turns out that most of their concurrent
          changes don't overlap at all; conflicts are infrequent.  And
          the amount of time it takes to resolve conflicts is usually
          far less than the time lost by a locking system.</p>
          <p>In the end, it all comes down to one critical factor:
          user communication.  When users communicate poorly, both
          syntactic and semantic conflicts increase.  No system can
          force users to communicate perfectly, and no system can
          detect semantic conflicts.  So there's no point in being
          lulled into a false sense of security that a locking system
          will somehow prevent conflicts; in practice, locking seems
          to inhibit productivity more than anything else.</p>

            <p>While the lock-modify-unlock model is considered
            generally harmful to collaboration, sometimes
            locking is appropriate.</p>
            <p>The copy-modify-merge model is based on the assumption
            that files are contextually mergeable—that is, that the
            majority of the files in the repository are line-based text
            files (such as program source code).  But for files with
            binary formats, such as artwork or sound, it's often
            impossible to merge conflicting changes.  In these
            situations, it really is necessary for users to take strict
            turns when changing the file.  Without serialized access,
            somebody ends up wasting time on changes that are ultimately
            discarded.</p>
            <p>While Subversion is primarily a copy-modify-merge
            system, it still recognizes the need to lock an occasional
            file, and thus provides mechanisms for this.  We discuss
            this feature in <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.locking.html" title="Locking">the section called “Locking”</a>.</p>
