      <p>Suppose it's your job to maintain a document for a division
      in your company—a handbook of some sort.  One day a different
      division asks you for the same handbook, but with a few parts
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tweaked</span>”</span> for them, since they do things slightly
      differently.</p>
      <p>What do you do in this situation?  You do the obvious: make
      a second copy of your document and begin maintaining the two
      copies separately.  As each department asks you to make small
      changes, you incorporate them into one copy or the other.</p>
      <p>You often want to make the same change to both copies.  For
      example, if you discover a typo in the first copy, it's very
      likely that the same typo exists in the second copy.  The two
      documents are almost the same, after all; they differ only in
      small, specific ways.</p>

      This is the basic concept of a branch—namely,
      a line of development that exists independently of another line,
      yet still shares a common history if you look far enough back in
      time.  A branch always begins life as a copy of something, and
      moves on from there, generating its own history (see
      <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.whatis.html#svn.branchmerge.whatis.dia-1" title="Figure 4.1. Branches of development">Figure 4.1, “Branches of development”</a>).</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <a id="svn.branchmerge.whatis.dia-1"></a>
        <p class="title">
          <strong>Figure 4.1. Branches of development</strong>

      <p>Subversion has commands to help you maintain parallel
      branches of your files and directories.  It allows you to create
      branches by copying your data, and remembers that the copies are
      related to one another.  It also helps you duplicate changes
      from one branch to another.  Finally, it can make portions of
      your working copy reflect different branches so that you can
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mix and match</span>”</span> different lines of development in
      your daily work.</p>
