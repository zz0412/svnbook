      <p>In any given working copy, there is a good chance that
      alongside all those versioned files and directories are other
      files and directories that are neither versioned nor intended
      to be.  Text editors litter directories with backup files.
      Software compilers generate intermediate—or even
      final—files that you typically wouldn't bother to
      version.  And users themselves drop various other files and
      directories wherever they see fit, often in version control
      working copies.</p>
      <p>It's ludicrous to expect Subversion working copies to be
      somehow impervious to this kind of clutter and impurity.  In
      fact, Subversion counts it as a <span class="emphasis"><em>feature</em></span>
      that its working copies are just typical directories, just like
      unversioned trees.  But these not-to-be-versioned files and
      directories can cause some annoyance for Subversion users.  For
      example, because the <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      import</strong></span> commands act recursively by default and don't
      know which files in a given tree you do and don't wish to
      version, it's easy to accidentally add stuff to version control
      that you didn't mean to.  And because <span class="command"><strong>svn
      status</strong></span> reports, by default, every item of interest in
      a working copy—including unversioned files and
      directories—its output can get quite noisy where many of
      these things exist.</p>
      <p>So Subversion provides two ways for telling it which files
      you would prefer that it simply disregard.  One of the ways
      involves the use of Subversion's runtime configuration system
      (see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.confarea.html" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called “Runtime Configuration Area”</a>), and therefore
      applies to all the Subversion operations that make use of that
      runtime configuration—generally those performed on a particular
      computer or by a particular user of a computer.  The other way
      makes use of Subversion's directory property support and is more
      tightly bound to the versioned tree itself, and therefore
      affects everyone who has a working copy of that tree.  Both of
      the mechanisms use <em class="firstterm">file patterns</em> (strings
      of literal and special wildcard characters used to match against
      filenames) to decide which files to ignore.</p>
      <p>The Subversion runtime configuration system provides an
      option, <code class="literal">global-ignores</code>, whose value is a
      whitespace-delimited collection of file patterns.  The
      Subversion client checks these patterns against the names of the
      files that are candidates for addition to version control, as
      well as to unversioned files that the <span class="command"><strong>svn
      status</strong></span> command notices.  If any file's name matches
      one of the patterns, Subversion will basically act as if the
      file didn't exist at all.  This is really useful for the kinds
      of files that you almost never want to version, such as editor
      backup files such as Emacs' <code class="literal">*~</code> and
      <code class="literal">.*~</code> files.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>File patterns (also called <em class="firstterm">globs</em> or
        <em class="firstterm">shell wildcard patterns</em>) are strings of
        characters that are intended to be matched against filenames,
        typically for the purpose of quickly selecting some subset of
        similar files from a larger grouping without having to
        explicitly name each file.  The patterns contain two types of
        characters:  regular characters, which are compared explicitly
        against potential matches, and special wildcard characters,
        which are interpreted differently for matching
        purposes.</p>
        <p>There are different types of file pattern syntaxes, but
        Subversion uses the one most commonly found in Unix systems
        implemented as the <code class="function">fnmatch</code> system
        function.  It supports the following wildcards, described here
        simply for your convenience:</p>
        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">
                <code class="literal">?</code>
              </span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Matches any single character</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">
                <code class="literal">*</code>
              </span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Matches any string of characters, including the
              empty string</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">
                <code class="literal">[</code>
              </span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Begins a character class definition terminated by
              <code class="literal">]</code>, used for matching a subset of
              characters</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
        <p>You can see this same pattern matching behavior at a Unix
        shell prompt.  The following are some examples of patterns
        being used for various things:</p>

        <p>File pattern matching is a bit more complex than what
        we've described here, but this basic usage level tends to suit
        the majority of Subversion users.</p>
      </div>
      <p>When found on a versioned directory, the
      <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property is expected to contain a
      list of newline-delimited file patterns that Subversion should
      use to determine ignorable objects in that same directory.
      These patterns do not override those found in the
      <code class="literal">global-ignores</code> runtime configuration option,
      but are instead appended to that list.  And it's worth noting
      again that, unlike the <code class="literal">global-ignores</code> option,
      the patterns found in the <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code>
      property apply only to the directory on which that property is
      set, and not to any of its subdirectories.  The
      <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property is a good way to tell
      Subversion to ignore files that are likely to be present in
      every user's working copy of that directory, such as compiler
      output or—to use an example more appropriate to this
      book—the HTML, PDF, or PostScript files generated as the
      result of a conversion of some source DocBook XML files to a
      more legible output format.</p>

        files and directories to version control.  Once an object is
        under Subversion's control, the ignore pattern mechanisms no
        longer apply to it.  In other words, don't expect Subversion
        to avoid committing changes you've made to a versioned file
        simply because that file's name matches an ignore
        pattern—Subversion <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> notices

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Subversion <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property is
        very similar in syntax and function to the CVS
        <code class="filename">.cvsignore</code> file.  In fact, if you are
        migrating a CVS working copy to Subversion, you can directly
        migrate the ignore patterns by using the
        <code class="filename">.cvsignore</code> file as input file to the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> command:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F .cvsignore .
property 'svn:ignore' set on '.'
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>There are, however, some differences in the ways that CVS
        and Subversion handle ignore patterns.  The two systems use
        the ignore patterns at some different times, and there are
        slight discrepancies in what the ignore patterns apply to.
        Also, Subversion does not recognize the use of the
        <code class="literal">!</code> pattern as a reset back to having no
        ignore patterns at all.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The global list of ignore patterns tends to be more a
      matter of personal taste and ties more closely to a user's
      particular tool chain than to the details of any particular
      working copy's needs.  So, the rest of this section will focus
      on the <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property and its
      uses.</p>
      <p>Say you have the following output from <span class="command"><strong>svn
      status</strong></span>:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn status calc
 M      calc/button.c
?       calc/calculator
?       calc/data.c
?       calc/debug_log
?       calc/debug_log.1
?       calc/debug_log.2.gz
?       calc/debug_log.3.gz
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, you have made some property modifications
      to <code class="filename">button.c</code>, but in your working copy, you
      also have some unversioned files: the latest
      <code class="filename">calculator</code> program that you've compiled
      from your source code, a source file named
      <code class="filename">data.c</code>, and a set of debugging output
      logfiles.  Now, you know that your build system always results
      in the <code class="filename">calculator</code> program being
      generated.<sup>[<a id="idp9367552" href="#ftn.idp9367552" class="footnote">18</a>]</sup>  And you know that your test suite
      always leaves those debugging logfiles lying around.  These
      facts are true for all working copies of this project, not just
      your own.  And you know that you aren't interested in seeing
      those things every time you run
      <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>, and you are pretty sure that
      nobody else is interested in them either.  So you use
      <strong class="userinput"><code>svn propedit svn:ignore calc</code></strong> to add some
      ignore patterns to the <code class="filename">calc</code>
      directory.</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:ignore calc
calculator
debug_log*
$
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>After you've added this property, you will now have a local
      property modification on the <code class="filename">calc</code>
      directory.  But notice what else is different about your
      <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> output:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn status
 M      calc
 M      calc/button.c
?       calc/data.c
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Now, all that cruft is missing from the output!  Your
      <code class="filename">calculator</code> compiled program and all those
      logfiles are still in your working copy; Subversion just isn't
      constantly reminding you that they are present and unversioned.
      And now with all the uninteresting noise removed from the
      display, you are left with more intriguing items—such as
      that source code file <code class="filename">data.c</code> that you
      probably forgot to add to version control.</p>
      <p>Of course, this less-verbose report of your working copy
      status isn't the only one available.  If you actually want to
      see the ignored files as part of the status report, you can pass
      the <code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option to Subversion:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn status --no-ignore
 M      calc
 M      calc/button.c
I       calc/calculator
?       calc/data.c
I       calc/debug_log
I       calc/debug_log.1
I       calc/debug_log.2.gz
I       calc/debug_log.3.gz
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, the list of file patterns to ignore is
      also used by <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      import</strong></span>.  Both of these operations involve asking
      Subversion to begin managing some set of files and directories.
      Rather than force the user to pick and choose which files in a
      tree she wishes to start versioning, Subversion uses the ignore
      patterns—both the global and the per-directory
      lists—to determine which files should not be swept into
      the version control system as part of a larger recursive
      addition or import operation.  And here again, you can use the
      <code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option to tell Subversion to disregard
      its ignores list and operate on all the files and directories
      present.</p>
      <div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <table border="0" summary="Tip">

            <th align="left">Tip</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>Even if <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> is set, you may run
        into problems if you use shell wildcards in a command.  Shell
        wildcards are expanded into an explicit list of targets before
        Subversion operates on them, so running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        <em class="replaceable"><code>SUBCOMMAND</code></em> *</code></strong> is just like
        running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn <em class="replaceable"><code>SUBCOMMAND</code></em>
        file1 file2 file3 …</code></strong>.  In the case of the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> command, this has an effect similar
        to passing the <code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option.  So
        instead of using a wildcard, use <strong class="userinput"><code>svn add --force
        .</code></strong> to do a bulk scheduling of unversioned things for
        addition.  The explicit target will ensure that the current
        directory isn't overlooked because of being already under
        version control, and the <code class="option">--force</code> option will
        cause Subversion to crawl through that directory, adding
        unversioned files while still honoring the
        <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property and
        <code class="literal">global-ignores</code> runtime configuration
        variable.  Be sure to also provide the <code class="option">--depth
        files</code> option to the <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span>
        command if you don't want a fully recursive crawl for things
        to add.</p>
