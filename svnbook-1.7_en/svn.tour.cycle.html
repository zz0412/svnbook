      <p>Subversion has numerous features, options, bells, and
      whistles, but on a day-to-day basis, odds are that you will use
      only a few of them.  In this section, we'll run through the most
      common things that you might find yourself doing with Subversion
      in the course of a day's work.</p>
      <p>The typical work cycle looks like this:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Update your working copy.</em></span> This
          involves the use of the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
          command.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Make your changes.</em></span> The most common
          changes that you'll make are edits to the contents of your
          existing files.  But sometimes you need to add, remove, copy
          and move files and directories—the <span class="command"><strong>svn
          add</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          copy</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> commands
          handle those sorts of structural changes within the working
          copy.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Review your changes.</em></span>
          The <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          diff</strong></span> commands are critical to reviewing the
          changes you've made in your working copy.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Fix your mistakes.</em></span>  Nobody's
          perfect, so as you review your changes, you may spot
          something that's not quite right.  Sometimes the easiest way
          to fix a mistake is start all over again from scratch.
          The <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> command restores a file
          or directory to its unmodified state.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Resolve any conflicts (merge others'
          changes).</em></span>  In the time it takes you to make and
          review your changes, others might have made and published
          changes, too.  You'll want to integrate their changes into
          your working copy to avoid the potential out-of-dateness
          scenarios when you attempt to publish your own.  Again,
          the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command is the way to do
          this.  If this results in local conflicts, you'll need to
          resolve those using the <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>
          command.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Publish (commit) your changes.</em></span>
          The <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command transmits your
          changes to the repository where, if they are accepted, they
          create the newest versions of all the things you modified.
          Now others can see your work, too!</p>

      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Update Your Working Copy">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cycle.update"></a>Update Your Working Copy</h3>

        <a id="idp7712000" class="indexterm"></a>
        <p>When working on a project that is being modified via
        multiple working copies, you'll want to update your working
        copy to receive any changes committed from other working
        copies since your last update.  These might be changes that
        other members of your project team have made, or they might
        simply be changes you've made yourself from a different
        computer.  To protect your data, Subversion won't
        allow you commit new changes to out-of-date files and
        directories, so it's best to have the latest versions
        of all your project's files and directories before making new
        changes of your own.</p>
        <p>Use <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring your working
        copy into sync with the latest revision in the
        repository:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn update
Updating '.':
U    foo.c
U    bar.c
Updated to revision 2.
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In this case, it appears that someone checked in
        modifications to both <code class="filename">foo.c</code>
        and <code class="filename">bar.c</code> since the last time you
        updated, and Subversion has updated your working copy to
        include those changes.</p>
        <p>When the server sends changes to your working copy via
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, a letter code is displayed next
        to each item to let you know what actions Subversion performed
        to bring your working copy up to date.  To find out what these
        letters mean, run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn help update</code></strong> or
        see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.svn.c.update.html" title="svn update (up)">svn update (up)</a> in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.html" title="Chapter 9. Subversion Complete Reference">Chapter 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Make Your Changes">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cycle.edit"></a>Make Your Changes </h3>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Now you can get to work and make changes in your working
        copy.  You can make two kinds of changes to your working
        copy: <em class="firstterm">file changes</em> and <em class="firstterm">tree
        changes</em>.  You don't need to tell Subversion that
        you intend to change a file; just make your changes using your
        text editor, word processor, graphics program, or whatever
        tool you would normally use.  Subversion automatically detects
        which files have been changed, and in addition, it handles
        binary files just as easily as it handles text files—and
        just as efficiently, too.  Tree changes are different, and
        involve changes to a directory's structure.  Such changes
        include adding and removing files, renaming files or
        directories, and copying files or directories to new
        locations.  For tree changes, you use Subversion operations
        to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">schedule</span>”</span> files and directories for removal,
        addition, copying, or moving.  These changes may take place
        immediately in your working copy, but no additions or removals
        will happen in the repository until you commit them.</p>
        <div class="sidebar" title="Versioning Symbolic Links">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <p class="title">
                  <strong>Versioning Symbolic Links</strong>
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>On non-Windows platforms, Subversion is able to version
          files of the special type <em class="firstterm">symbolic
          link</em> (or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">symlink</span>”</span>).  A symlink is
          a file that acts as a sort of transparent reference to some
          other object in the filesystem, allowing programs to read
          and write to those objects indirectly by performing
          operations on the symlink itself.</p>
          <p>When a symlink is committed into a Subversion
          repository, Subversion remembers that the file was in fact a
          symlink, as well as the object to which the symlink
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">points.</span>”</span>  When that symlink is checked out to
          another working copy on a non-Windows system, Subversion
          reconstructs a real filesystem-level symbolic link from the
          versioned symlink.  But that doesn't in any way limit the
          usability of working copies on systems such as Windows that
          do not support symlinks.  On such systems, Subversion simply
          creates a regular text file whose contents are the path to
          which the original symlink pointed.  While that file
          can't be used as a symlink on a Windows system, it also
          won't prevent Windows users from performing their other
          Subversion-related activities.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Here is an overview of the five Subversion subcommands
        that you'll use most often to make tree changes:</p>

              commit, <code class="filename">FOO</code> will become a child of
              its parent directory.  Note that if
              <code class="filename">FOO</code> is a directory, everything
              underneath <code class="filename">FOO</code> will be scheduled
              for addition.  If you want only to add
              <code class="filename">FOO</code> itself, pass the

              file or link, it is immediately deleted from your
              working copy.  If <code class="filename">FOO</code> is a
              directory, it is not deleted, but Subversion schedules
              it for deletion.  When you commit your
              changes, <code class="filename">FOO</code> will be entirely
              removed from your working copy and the
              repository.<sup>[<a id="idp7745872" href="#ftn.idp7745872" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup></p>

          <p>Subversion <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> offer ways to
          immediately commit tree changes to the repository without an
          explicit commit action.  In particular, specific uses
          of <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>, and
          <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> can operate directly on
          repository URLs as well as on working copy paths.  Of
          course, as previously mentioned, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          import</strong></span> always makes direct changes to the
          repository.</p>
          <p>There are pros and cons to performing URL-based
          operations.  One obvious advantage to doing so is speed:
          sometimes, checking out a working copy that you don't
          already have solely to perform some seemingly simple action
          is an overbearing cost.  A disadvantage is that you are
          generally limited to a single, or single type of, operation
          at a time when operating directly on URLs.  Finally, the
          primary advantage of a working copy is in its utility as a
          sort of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">staging area</span>”</span> for changes.  You can
          make sure that the changes you are about to commit make
          sense in the larger scope of your project before committing
          them.  And, of course, these staged changes can be as
          complex or as a simple as they need to be, yet result in but
          a single new revision when committed.</p>

        <p>Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit
        them to the repository, but before you do so, it's usually a
        good idea to take a look at exactly what you've changed.  By
        examining your changes before you commit, you can compose a
        more accurate <em class="firstterm">log message</em> (a
        human-readable description of the committed changes stored
        alongside those changes in the repository).  You may also
        discover that you've inadvertently changed a file, and that
        you need to undo that change before committing.  Additionally,
        this is a good opportunity to review and scrutinize changes
        before publishing them.  You can see an overview of the
        changes you've made by using the <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>
        command, and you can dig into the details of those changes by
        using the <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> command.</p>

          repository <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> across the network.  This
          makes it easy to manage and review your changes-in-progress
          when you are working offline or are otherwise unable to
          contact your repository over the network.</p>

          <a id="idp7786080" class="indexterm"></a>
          <p>Subversion does this by keeping private caches of
          pristine, unmodified versions of each versioned file inside
          its working copy administrative area (or prior to version 1.7,
          potentially multiple administrative areas).  This allows
          Subversion to report—and revert—local
          modifications to those files <span class="emphasis"><em>without network
          access</em></span>.  This cache (called the
          <em class="firstterm">text-base</em>) also allows Subversion to
          send the user's local modifications during a commit to the
          server as a compressed <em class="firstterm">delta</em> (or
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">difference</span>”</span>) against the pristine version.
          Having this cache is a tremendous benefit—even if you
          have a fast Internet connection, it's generally much faster
          to send only a file's changes rather than the whole file to
          the server.</p>

          sometimes it is useful to see which of the items in your

          <p>Notice in the previous example the two asterisks: if you
          were to run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong> at this point,
          you would receive changes to <code class="filename">README</code>
          and <code class="filename">trout.c</code>.  This tells you some very
          useful information—because one of those items is also
          one that you have locally modified (the
          file <code class="filename">README</code>), you'll need to update and
          get the servers changes for that file before you commit, or
          the repository will reject your commit for being out of
          date.  We discuss this in more detail later.</p>
          <p><span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> can display much more

          <p>Another way to examine your changes is with the
          <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> command, which displays
          differences in file content.  When you run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
          diff</code></strong> at the top of your working copy with no
          arguments, Subversion will print the changes you've made to
          human-readable files in your working copy.  It displays
          those changes in <em class="firstterm">unified diff</em> format,
          a format which describes changes as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hunks</span>”</span>
          (or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">snippets</span>”</span>) of a file's content where each
          line of text is prefixed with a single-character code: a
          space, which means the line was unchanged; a minus sign
          (<code class="literal">-</code>), which means the line was removed
          from the file; or a plus sign (<code class="literal">+</code>), which
          means the line was added to the file.  In the context
          of <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, those minus-sign- and
          plus-sign-prefixed lines show how the lines looked before
          and after your modifications, respectively.</p>

          <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> command produces this
          output by comparing your working files against its pristine
          text-base.  Files scheduled for addition are displayed as
          files in which every line was added; files scheduled for
          deletion are displayed as if every line was removed from
          those files.  The output from <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> is
          somehwat compatible with the <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span>
          program—more so with the <span class="command"><strong>svn patch</strong></span>
          subcommand introduced in Subversion 1.7.  Patch processing
          commands such as these read and apply <em class="firstterm">patch
          files</em> (or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">patches</span>”</span>), which are
          files that describe differences made to one or more files.
          Because of this, you can share the changes you've made in
          your working copy with someone else without first committing
          those changes by creating a patch file from the redirected
          output of <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn diff &gt; patchfile

</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Subversion uses its internal diff engine, which produces
          unified diff format, by default.  If you want diff output in
          a different format, specify an external diff program using
          <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and pass any additional flags
          that it needs via the <code class="option">--extensions</code>
          (<code class="option">-x</code>) option.  For example, you might want
          Subversion to defer its difference calculation and display
          to the GNU <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> program, asking that
          program to print local modifications made to the
          file <code class="filename">foo.c</code> in context diff format
          (another flavor of difference format) while ignoring changes
          made only to the case of the letters used in the file's
          contents:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn diff --diff-cmd /usr/bin/diff -x "-i" foo.c

        </div>
        <p>Suppose while viewing the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff</strong></span> you determine that all the changes you made to
        a particular file are mistakes.  Maybe you shouldn't have
        changed the file at all, or perhaps it would be easier to make
        different changes starting from scratch.  You could edit the
        file again and unmake all those changes.  You could try to
        find a copy of how the file looked before you changed it, and
        then copy its contents atop your modified version.  You
        could attempt to apply those changes to the file again in
        reverse using <strong class="userinput"><code>patch -R</code></strong>.  And there are
        probably other approaches you could take.</p>
        <a id="idp7871936" class="indexterm"></a>
        <p>Fortunately in Subversion, undoing your work and starting
        over from scratch doesn't require such acrobatics.  Just use
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> command:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn status README
M       README
$ svn revert README
Reverted 'README'
$ svn status README
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In this example, Subversion has reverted the file to its
        premodified state by overwriting it with the pristine version
        of the file cached in the text-base area.  But note that
        <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> can undo
        <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> scheduled operation—for
        example, you might decide that you don't want to add a new
        file after all:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn status new-file.txt
?       new-file.txt
$ svn add new-file.txt

$ svn status new-file.txt
?       new-file.txt
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Or perhaps you mistakenly removed a file from version
        control:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">

        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> command offers salvation
        for imperfect people.  It can save you huge amounts of time
        and energy that would otherwise be spent manually unmaking
        changes or, worse, disposing of your working copy and checking
        out a fresh one just to have a clean slate to work with
        again.</p>

        <p>We've already seen how <strong class="userinput"><code>svn status
        -u</code></strong> can predict conflicts, but dealing with those
        conflicts is still something that remains to be done.
        Conflicts can occur any time you attempt to merge or integrate
        (in a very general sense) changes from the repository into
        your working copy.  By now you know that <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span> creates exactly that sort of
        scenario—that command's very purpose is to bring your
        working copy up to date with the repository by merging all the
        changes made since your last update into your working
        copy.  So how does Subversion report these conflicts to you,
        and how do you deal with them?</p>
        <p>Suppose you run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong> and you
        see this sort of interesting output:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn update
Updating '.':
U    INSTALL
G    README
Conflict discovered in 'bar.c'.

        (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
        (s) show all options: 
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The <code class="computeroutput">U</code> (which stands for
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Updated</span>”</span>) and <code class="computeroutput">G</code>
        (for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">merGed</span>”</span>) codes are no cause for concern;
        those files cleanly absorbed changes from the repository.  A
        file marked with <code class="computeroutput">U</code> contains
        no local changes but was updated with changes from the
        repository.  One marked with
        <code class="computeroutput">G</code> had local changes to begin
        with, but the changes coming from the repository didn't
        overlap with those local changes.</p>
        <p>It's the next few lines which are interesting.  First,
        Subversion reports to you that in its attempt to merge
        outstanding server changes into the
        file <code class="filename">bar.c</code>, it has detected that some of
        those changes clash with local modifications you've made to
        that file in your working copy but have not yet committed.
        Perhaps someone has changed the same line of text you also
        changed.  Whatever the reason, Subversion instantly flags this
        file as being in a state of conflict.  It then asks you what
        you want to do about the problem, allowing you to
        interactively choose an action to take toward resolving the
        conflict.  The most commonly used options are displayed, but
        you can see all of the options by
        typing <em class="replaceable"><code>s</code></em>:</p>

          <p>Before deciding how to attack a conflict interactively,
          odds are that you'd like to see exactly what is in conflict.
          Two of the commands available at the interactive conflict
          resolution prompt can assist you here.  The first is
          the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">diff-full</span>”</span> command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>df</code></strong>), which displays all the local
          modifications to the file in question plus any conflict
          regions:</p>

</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The first line of the diff content shows the previous
          contents of the working copy (the <code class="literal">BASE</code>
          revision), the next content line is your change, and the
          last content line is the change that was just received from
          the server (<span class="emphasis"><em>usually</em></span> the
          <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision).</p>
          <p>The second command is similar to the first, but
          the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">display-conflict</span>”</span>
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>dc</code></strong>) command shows only the conflict
          regions, not all the changes made to the file.
          Additionally, this command uses a slightly different display
          format for the conflict regions which allows you to more
          easily compare the file's contents in those regions as they
          would appear in each of three states: original and unedited;
          with your local changes applied and the server's conflicting
          changes ignored; and with only the server's incoming changes
          applied and your local, conflicting changes reverted.</p>
          <p>After reviewing the information provided by these
          commands, you're ready to move on to the next action.</p>
        </div>

          <p>There are several different ways to resolve conflicts
          interactively—two of which allow you to selectively
          merge and edit changes, the rest of which allow you to
          simply pick a version of the file and move along.</p>
          <p>If you wish to choose some combination of your local
          changes, you can use the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">edit</span>”</span> command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>e</code></strong>) to manually edit the file with
          conflict markers in a text editor (configured per the
          instructions in <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.externaleditors.html" title="Using External Editors">the section called “Using External Editors”</a>).  After you've edited the file, if you're satisfied with
          the changes you've made, you can tell Subversion that the
          edited file is no longer in conflict by using
          the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">resolved</span>”</span> command
          (<code class="literal">r</code>).</p>
          <p>Regardless of what your local Unix snob will likely tell
          you, editing the file by hand in your favorite text editor
          is a somewhat low-tech way of remedying conflicts (see
          <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve.byhand" title="Merging conflicts by hand">the section called “Merging conflicts by hand”</a> for a
          walkthrough).  For this reason, Subversion provides
          the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">launch</span>”</span> resolution command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>l</code></strong>) to fire up a fancy graphical
          merge tool instead (see
          <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.externaldifftools.html#svn.advanced.externaldifftools.merge" title="External merge">the section called “External merge”</a>).</p>
          <p>If you decide that you don't need to merge any changes,
          but just want to accept one version of the file or the
          other, you can either choose your changes (a.k.a.
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mine</span>”</span>) by using the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mine-full</span>”</span>
          command (<strong class="userinput"><code>mf</code></strong>) or choose theirs by using the
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">theirs-full</span>”</span> command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>tf</code></strong>).</p>
          <p>Finally, there is also a pair of compromise options
          available.  The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mine-conflict</span>”</span>
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>mc</code></strong>)
          and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">theirs-conflict</span>”</span>
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>tc</code></strong>) commands instruct Subversion to
          select your local changes or the server's incoming changes,
          respectively, as the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">winner</span>”</span> for all conflicts
          in the file.  But, unlike the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mine-full</span>”</span>
          and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">theirs-full</span>”</span> commands, these commands
          preserve both your local changes and changes received from
          the server in regions of the file where no conflict was
          detected.</p>

          <p>This may sound like an appropriate section for avoiding
          marital disagreements, but it's actually still about
          Subversion, so read on.  If you're doing an update and
          encounter a conflict that you're not prepared to review or
          resolve, you can type <strong class="userinput"><code>p</code></strong> to postpone
          resolving a conflict on a file-by-file basis when you run
          <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong>.  If you know in advance
          that you don't want to resolve any conflicts interactively,
          you can pass the <code class="option">--non-interactive</code> option
          to <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, and any file in conflict
          will be marked with a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
          automatically.</p>
          <p>The <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
          (for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Conflicted</span>”</span>) means that the changes from the
          server overlapped with your own, and now you have to
          manually choose between them after the update has completed.
          When you postpone a conflict resolution,
          <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> typically does three things to assist
          you in noticing and resolving that conflict:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">

                <p>Subversion prints a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
              during the update and remembers that the file is in a
              state of conflict.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">

              conflict—into the file to visibly demonstrate the
              overlapping areas.  (Subversion uses the
              <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to decide whether a
              file is capable of contextual, line-based merging.  See

          <p>If you've postponed a conflict, you need to resolve the
          conflict before Subversion will allow you to commit your
          changes.  You'll do this with the <span class="command"><strong>svn
          resolve</strong></span> command and one of several arguments to
          the <code class="option">--accept</code> option.</p>
          <p>If you want to choose the version of the file that you
          last checked out before making your edits, choose
          the <em class="replaceable"><code>base</code></em> argument.</p>
          <p>If you want to choose the version that contains only
          your edits, choose the <em class="replaceable"><code>mine-full</code></em>
          argument.</p>
          <p>If you want to choose the version that your most recent
          update pulled from the server (and thus discarding your
          edits entirely), choose
          the <em class="replaceable"><code>theirs-full</code></em> argument.</p>
          <p>However, if you want to pick and choose from your
          changes and the changes that your update fetched from the
          server, merge the conflicted text <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">by hand</span>”</span> (by
          examining and editing the conflict markers within the file)
          and then choose the <em class="replaceable"><code>working</code></em>
          argument.</p>
          <p><span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span> removes the three
          temporary files and accepts the version of the file that you
          specified with the <code class="option">--accept</code> option, and

          <p>Merging conflicts by hand can be quite intimidating the
          first time you attempt it, but with a little practice, it
          can become as easy as falling off a bike.</p>
          <p>Here's an example.  Due to a miscommunication, you and
          Sally, your collaborator, both edit the file
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> at the same time.  Sally
          commits her changes, and when you go to update your working
          copy, you get a conflict and you're going to have to edit
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> to resolve the conflict.
          First, let's take a look at the file:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ cat sandwich.txt
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami

Sauerkraut

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
Creole Mustard
Bottom piece of bread
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The strings of less-than signs, equals signs, and
          greater-than signs are conflict markers and are not part of
          the actual data in conflict.  You generally want to ensure
          that those are removed from the file before your next
          commit.  The text between the first two sets of markers is
          composed of the changes you made in the conflicting
          area:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The text between the second and third sets of conflict
          markers is the text from Sally's commit:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Usually you won't want to just delete the conflict
          markers and Sally's changes—she's going to be awfully
          surprised when the sandwich arrives and it's not what she
          wanted.  This is where you pick up the phone or walk across
          the office and explain to Sally that you can't get
          sauerkraut from an Italian deli.<sup>[<a id="idp7973872" href="#ftn.idp7973872" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup>  Once you've agreed on the changes
          you will commit, edit your file and remove the conflict
          markers:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone

Mortadella
Prosciutto

Bottom piece of bread
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Now use <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, and you're
          ready to commit your changes:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn resolve --accept working sandwich.txt
Resolved conflicted state of 'sandwich.txt'
$ svn commit -m "Go ahead and use my sandwich, discarding Sally's edits."
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Note that <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, unlike most of
          the other commands we deal with in this chapter, requires
          that you explicitly list any filenames that you wish to
          resolve.  In any case, you want to be careful and use
          <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span> only when you're certain that
          you've fixed the conflict in your file—once the
          temporary files are removed, Subversion will let you commit
          the file even if it still contains conflict markers.</p>
          <p>If you ever get confused while editing the conflicted
          file, you can always consult the three files that Subversion
          creates for you in your working copy—including your
          file as it was before you updated.  You can even use a
          third-party interactive merging tool to examine those three
          files.</p>

        changes to the repository.</p>
        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command sends all of
        your changes to the repository.  When you commit a change, you
        need to supply a log message describing your change.  Your log
        message will be attached to the new revision you create.  If
        your log message is brief, you may wish to supply it on the
        command line using the <code class="option">--message</code>
        (<code class="option">-m</code>) option:</p>

        <p>However, if you've been composing your log message in some
        other text file as you work, you may want to tell Subversion
        to get the message from that file by passing its filename as
        the value of the <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>)
