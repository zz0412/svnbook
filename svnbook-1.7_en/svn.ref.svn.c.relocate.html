        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sometimes an administrator might change the location
            (or apparent location, from the client's perspective) of a
            repository.  The content of the repository doesn't change,
            but the repository's root URL does.  The hostname may
            change because the repository is now being served from a
            different computer.  Or, perhaps the URL scheme changes
            because the repository is now being served via SSL
            (using <code class="literal">https://</code>) instead of over plain
            HTTP.  There are many different reasons for these types of
            repository relocations.  But ideally, a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">change of
            address</span>”</span> for a repository shouldn't suddently cause
            all the working copies which point to that repository to
            become forever unusable.  And fortunately, that's not the
            case.  Rather than force users to check out a new working
            copy when a repository is relocated, Subversion provides
            the <span class="command"><strong>svn relocate</strong></span> command, which 
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">rewrites</span>”</span> the working copy's administrative
            metadata to refer to the new repository location.</p>
        <p>The first <span class="command"><strong>svn relocate</strong></span> syntax
            allows you to update one or more working copies by what
            essentially amounts to a find-and-replace within the
            repository root URLs recorded in those working copies.
            Subversion will replace the initial substring
            <em class="replaceable"><code>FROM-PREFIX</code></em> with the
            string <em class="replaceable"><code>TO-PREFIX</code></em> in those URLs.
            These initial URL substrings can be as long or as short as
            is necessary to differentiate between them.  Obviously, to
            use this syntax form, you need to know both the current
            root URL of the repository to which the working copy is
            pointing, and the new URL of that repository.
            (You can use <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> to determine
            the former.)</p>
        <p>The second syntax does not require that you know the
            current repository root URL with which the working copy is
            associated at all—only the new repository URL
            (<em class="replaceable"><code>TO-URL</code></em>) to which it should be
            pointing.  In this syntax form, only one working copy may
            be relocated at a time.</p>

        <a id="idp18876048"></a>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Let's start with a working copy that reflects a local
            repository URL:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn info | grep URL:
URL: file:///var/svn/repos/trunk
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>One day the administrator decides to rename the
            on-disk repository directory.  We missed the memo, so we
            see an error the next time we try to update our working
            copy.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn up
Updating '.':
svn: E180001: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'file:///var/svn/repos/trunk'
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>After cornering the administrator over by the vending
            machines, we learn about the repository being moved and
            are told the new URL.  Rather than checkout a new working
            copy, though, we simply ask Subversion to rewrite the
            working copy metadata to point to the new repository
            location.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn relocate file:///var/svn/new-repos/trunk
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion doesn't tell us much about what it did, but
            hey—error-free operation is really all we need,
            right?  Our working copy is functional for online
            operations again.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn up

A    lib/new.c
M    src/code.h

              <td align="left" valign="top">
                <p>Once again, this type of relocation
              affects <span class="emphasis"><em>working copy metadata only</em></span>.
              It will not change your versioned or unversioned file
              contents, perform any version control operations (such
              as commits or updates), and so on.</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>A few months later, we're told that the company is
            moving development to separate machines and that we'll be
            using HTTP to access the repository.  So we relocate our
            working copy again.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn relocate http://svn.company.com/repos/trunk
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Now, each time we perform a relocation of this sort,
            Subversion contacts the repository—at its new URL,
            of course—to verify a few things.</p>
        <p>First, it wants to compare the UUID of the repository
            against what is stored in the working copy.  If these UUIDs
            don't match, the working copy relocation is disallowed.
            Maybe this isn't the same repository (just in a new
            location) after all?</p>
        <p>Secondly, Subversion wants to ensure that the updated
            working copy metadata jives with respect to the directory
            location <span class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> the repository.
            Subversion won't let you accidentally relocate a working
            copy of a branch in your repository to the URL of a
            different branch in the same repository.  (That's
            what <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>, described in
            <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.svn.c.switch.html" title="svn switch (sw)">svn switch (sw)</a>, is for.)</p>
        <p>Also, Subversion will not allow you to relocate a
            subtree of the working copy.  If you're going to relocate
            the working copy at all, you must relocate the whole
            thing.  This is to protect the integrity of the working
            copy metadata and behavior as a whole.  (And really, you'd
            be hard pressed to come up with a compelling reason to
            relocate only a piece of your working copy anyway.)</p>
        <p>Let's look at one final relocation opportunity.  After
            using HTTP access for some time, the company moves to
            SSL-only access.  Now, the only change to the repository
            URL is that the scheme goes from
            being <code class="literal">http://</code> to
            being <code class="literal">https://</code>.  There are two
            different ways that we could make our working copy reflect
            ths change.  The first is to do exactly as we've done
            before and relocate to the new repository URL.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn relocate http://svn.company.com/repos/trunk
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>But we have another option here, too.  We could simply
            ask Subversion to swap out the changed prefixes of the
            URL.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn relocate http https
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Either approach leaves us a working copy whose
            metadata has been updated to point to the right repository
            location.</p>
        <p>By default, <span class="command"><strong>svn relocate</strong></span> will
            traverse any external working copies nested within your
            working copy and attempt relocation of those working
            copies, too.  Use the <code class="option">--ignore-externals</code>
            option to disable this behavior.</p>
