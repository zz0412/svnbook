      <p>Fortunately for Subversion users who routinely find
      themselves on different computers with different operating
      systems, Subversion's command-line program behaves almost
      identically on all those systems.  If you know how to wield
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> on one platform, you know how to wield it
      everywhere.</p>
      <p>However, the same is not always true of other general classes
      of software or of the actual files you keep in Subversion.  For
      example, on a Windows machine, the definition of a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text
      file</span>”</span> would be similar to that used on a Linux box, but
      with a key difference—the character sequences used to mark
      the ends of the lines of those files.  There are other
      differences, too.  Unix platforms have (and Subversion supports)
      symbolic links; Windows does not.  Unix platforms use filesystem
      permission to determine executability; Windows uses filename
      extensions.</p>
      <p>Because Subversion is in no position to unite the whole
      world in common definitions and implementations of all of these
      things, the best it can do is to try to help make your life
      simpler when you need to work with your versioned files and
      directories on multiple computers and operating systems.  This
      section describes some of the ways Subversion does this.</p>

        <p>Subversion joins the ranks of the many applications that
        recognize and make use of Multipurpose Internet Mail
        Extensions (MIME) content types.  Besides being a
        general-purpose storage location for a file's content type,
        the value of the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> file
        property determines some behavioral characteristics of
        Subversion itself.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Various programs on most modern operating systems make
          assumptions about the type and format of the contents of a
          file by the file's name, specifically its file extension.
          For example, files whose names end in
          <code class="filename">.txt</code> are generally assumed to be
          human-readable; that is, able to be understood by simple perusal
          rather than requiring complex processing to decipher.  Files
          whose names end in <code class="filename">.png</code>, on the other
          hand, are assumed to be of the Portable Network Graphics
          type—not human-readable at all, and sensible only when
          interpreted by software that understands the PNG format and
          can render the information in that format as a raster
          image.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, some of those extensions have changed
          their meanings over time.  When personal computers first appeared,
          a file named <code class="filename">README.DOC</code> would have
          almost certainly been a plain-text file, just like today's
          <code class="filename">.txt</code> files.  But by the mid-1990s, you
          could almost bet that a file of that name would not be a
          plain-text file at all, but instead a Microsoft Word
          document in a proprietary, non-human-readable format.  But
          this change didn't occur overnight—there was certainly
          a period of confusion for computer users over what exactly
          they had in hand when they saw a <code class="filename">.DOC</code>
          file.<sup>[<a id="idp9250672" href="#ftn.idp9250672" class="footnote">16</a>]</sup></p>
          <p>The popularity of computer networking cast still more
          doubt on the mapping between a file's name and its content.
          With information being served across networks and generated
          dynamically by server-side scripts, there was often no real
          file per se, and therefore no filename.  Web
          servers, for example, needed some other way to tell browsers
          what they were downloading so that the browser could do something
          intelligent with that information, whether that was to
          display the data using a program registered to handle that
          datatype or to prompt the user for where on the client
          machine to store the downloaded data.</p>
          <p>Eventually, a standard emerged for, among other things,
          describing the contents of a data stream.  In 1996, RFC 2045
          was published.  It was the first of five RFCs describing
          MIME.  It describes the concept of media types and subtypes
          and recommends a syntax for the representation of those
          types.  Today, MIME media types—or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">MIME
          types</span>”</span>—are used almost universally across
          email applications, web servers, and other software as the
          de facto mechanism for clearing up the file content
          confusion.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For example, one of the benefits that Subversion typically
        provides is contextual, line-based merging of changes received
        from the server during an update into your working file.  But
        for files containing nontextual data, there is often no
        concept of a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">line.</span>”</span>  So, for versioned files
        whose <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is set to a
        nontextual MIME type (generally, something that doesn't begin
        with <code class="literal">text/</code>, though there are exceptions),
        Subversion does not attempt to perform contextual merges
        during updates.  Instead, any time you have locally modified a
        binary working copy file that is also being updated, your file
        is left untouched and Subversion creates two new files.  One
        file has a <code class="filename">.oldrev</code> extension and contains
        the BASE revision of the file.  The other file has a
        <code class="filename">.newrev</code> extension and contains the
        contents of the updated revision of the file.  This behavior
        is really for the protection of the user against failed
        attempts at performing contextual merges on files that simply
        cannot be contextually merged.</p>
        <p>Additionally, since the acts of displaying line-based
        differences and line-based change attribution are, rather
        obviously, dependent on there being a meaningful definition
        of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">line</span>”</span> for a given file, files with nontextual
        MIME types will by default trigger errors when used as the
        targets of <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        annotate</strong></span> operations.  This can be especially
        frustrating for users with XML files whose
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is set to something
        such as <code class="literal">application/xml</code> which is not
        unambiguously human-readable and as such is treated as
        nontextual by Subversion.  Fortunately, those subcommands
        offer a <code class="option">--force</code> option for forcing
        Subversion to attempt the operations in spite of the apparent
        non-human-readability of the files.</p>

          cause some unexpected behaviors with respect to other
          properties.  For example, since the idea of line endings
          (and therefore, line-ending conversion) makes no sense when
          applied to nontextual files, Subversion will prevent you
          from setting the <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property
          on such files.  This is obvious when attempted on a single
          file target—<span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> will error
          out.  But it might not be as clear if you perform a
          recursive property set, where Subversion will silently skip
          over files that it deems unsuitable for a given
          property.</p>

        <p>Subversion provides a number of mechanisms by which to
        automatically set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
        property on a versioned file.  See
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.html#svn.advanced.props.auto" title="Automatic Property Setting">the section called “Automatic Property Setting”</a> for details.</p>
        <p>Also, if the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is
        set, then the Subversion Apache module will use its value to
        populate the <code class="literal">Content-type:</code> HTTP header when
        responding to GET requests.  This gives your web browser a
        crucial clue about how to display a file when you use it to
        peruse your Subversion repository's contents.</p>

        <p>On many operating systems, the ability to execute a file
        as a command is governed by the presence of an execute
        permission bit.  This bit usually defaults to being disabled,
        and must be explicitly enabled by the user for each file that
        needs it.  But it would be a monumental hassle to have to
        remember exactly which files in a freshly checked-out working
        copy were supposed to have their executable bits toggled on,
        and then to have to do that toggling.  So, Subversion provides
        the <code class="literal">svn:executable</code> property as a way to
        specify that the executable bit for the file on which that
        property is set should be enabled, and Subversion honors that
        request when populating working copies with such files.</p>
        <p>This property has no effect on filesystems that have no
        concept of an executable permission bit, such as FAT32 and
        NTFS.<sup>[<a id="idp8882320" href="#ftn.idp8882320" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup>  Also, although it has no defined
        values, Subversion will force its value
        to <code class="literal">*</code> when setting this property.  Finally,
        this property is valid only on files, not on
        directories.</p>

        <p>Unless otherwise noted using a versioned file's
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property, Subversion
        assumes the file contains human-readable data.  Generally
        speaking, Subversion uses this knowledge only to determine
        whether contextual difference reports for that file are
        possible.  Otherwise, to Subversion, bytes are bytes.</p>
        <p>This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any
        attention to the type of <em class="firstterm">end-of-line (EOL)
        markers</em> used in your files.  Unfortunately,
        different operating systems have different conventions about
        which character sequences represent the end of a line of text
        in a file.  For example, the usual line-ending token used by
        software on the Windows platform is a pair of ASCII control
        characters—a carriage return (<code class="literal">CR</code>)
        followed by a line feed (<code class="literal">LF</code>).  Unix
        software, however, just uses the <code class="literal">LF</code>
        character to denote the end of a line.</p>
        <p>Not all of the various tools on these operating systems
        understand files that contain line endings in a format that
        differs from the <em class="firstterm">native line-ending
        style</em> of the operating system on which they are
        running.  So, typically, Unix programs treat the
        <code class="literal">CR</code> character present in Windows files as a
        regular character (usually rendered as <code class="literal">^M</code>),
        and Windows programs combine all of the lines of a Unix file
        into one giant line because no carriage return-linefeed (or
        <code class="literal">CRLF</code>) character combination was found to
        denote the ends of the lines.</p>
        <p>This sensitivity to foreign EOL markers can be
        frustrating for folks who share a file across different
        operating systems.  For example, consider a source code
        file, and developers who edit this file on both Windows and
        Unix systems.  If all the developers always use tools that
        preserve the line-ending style of the file, no problems
        occur.</p>
        <p>But in practice, many common tools either fail to
        properly read a file with foreign EOL markers, or
        convert the file's line endings to the native style when the
        file is saved.  If the former is true for a developer, he
        has to use an external conversion utility (such as
        <span class="command"><strong>dos2unix</strong></span> or its companion,
        <span class="command"><strong>unix2dos</strong></span>) to prepare the file for
        editing.  The latter case requires no extra preparation.
        But both cases result in a file that differs from the
        original quite literally on every line!  Prior to committing
        his changes, the user has two choices.  Either he can use a
        conversion utility to restore the modified file to the same
        line-ending style that it was in before his edits were made,
        or he can simply commit the file—new EOL markers and
        all.</p>
        <p>The result of scenarios like these include wasted time
        and unnecessary modifications to committed files.  Wasted
        time is painful enough.  But when commits change every line
        in a file, this complicates the job of determining which of
        those lines were changed in a nontrivial way.  Where was
        that bug really fixed?  On what line was a syntax error
        introduced?</p>
        <p>The solution to this problem is the
        <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property.  When this
        property is set to a valid value, Subversion uses it to
        determine what special processing to perform on the file so
        that the file's line-ending style isn't flip-flopping with
        every commit that comes from a different operating
        system.  The valid values are:</p>
        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">
                <code class="literal">native</code>
              </span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This causes the file to contain the EOL markers
              that are native to the operating system on which
              Subversion was run.  In other words, if a user on a
              Windows machine checks out a working copy that
              contains a file with an
              <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property set to
              <code class="literal">native</code>, that file will contain
              <code class="literal">CRLF</code> EOL markers.  A Unix user
              checking out a working copy that contains the same
              file will see <code class="literal">LF</code> EOL markers in his
              copy of the file.</p>
              <p>Note that Subversion will actually store the file
              in the repository using normalized
              <code class="literal">LF</code> EOL markers regardless of the
              operating system.  This is basically transparent to
              the user, though.</p>
