<p>分支和<span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>有很多不同的用法，这个小节描述了最常见的用法。</p>
<p>Version control is most often used for software development, so here's a
quick peek at two of the most common branching/merging patterns used by
teams of programmers.  If you're not using Subversion for software
development, feel free to skip this section.  If you're a software developer
using version control for the first time, pay close attention, as these
patterns are often considered best practices by experienced folk.  These
processes aren't specific to Subversion; they're applicable to any version
control system.  Still, it may help to see them described in Subversion
terms.</p>

<p>Most software has a typical life cycle: code, test, release, repeat.  There
are two problems with this process.  First, developers need to keep writing
new features while quality assurance teams take time to test supposedly
stable versions of the software.  New work cannot halt while the software is
tested.  Second, the team almost always needs to support older, released
versions of software; if a bug is discovered in the latest code, it most
likely exists in released versions as well, and customers will want to get
that bug fix without having to wait for a major new release.</p>
<p>这是版本控制可以帮助你的。典型的过程如下：</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Developers commit all new work to the trunk.</em></span> Day-to-day
changes are committed to <code class="filename">/trunk</code>: new features, bug
fixes, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The trunk is copied to a “<span class="quote">release</span>” branch.</em></span>
When the team thinks the software is ready for release (say, a 1.0 release),
<code class="filename">/trunk</code> might be copied to
<code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Teams continue to work in parallel.</em></span> One team begins
rigorous testing of the release branch, while another team continues new
work (say, for version 2.0) on <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  If bugs are
discovered in either location, fixes are ported back and forth as
necessary.  At some point, however, even that process stops.  The branch is
“<span class="quote">frozen</span>” for final testing right before a release.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The branch is tagged and released.</em></span> When testing is
complete, <code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code> is copied to
<code class="filename">/tags/1.0.0</code> as a reference snapshot.  The tag is
packaged and released to customers.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The branch is maintained over time.</em></span> While work
continues on <code class="filename">/trunk</code> for version 2.0, bug fixes continue
to be ported from <code class="filename">/trunk</code> to
<code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code>.  When enough bug fixes have accumulated,
management may decide to do a 1.0.1 release:
<code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code> is copied to
<code class="filename">/tags/1.0.1</code>, and the tag is packaged and released.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>This entire process repeats as the software matures: when the 2.0 work is
complete, a new 2.0 release branch is created, tested, tagged, and
eventually released.  After some years, the repository ends up with a number
of release branches in “<span class="quote">maintenance</span>” mode, and a number of tags
representing final shipped versions.</p>

<a name="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.feature"></a>4.8.2. 特性分支</h3></div></div></div>
<p>A <em class="firstterm">feature branch</em> is the sort of branch that's been
the dominant example in this chapter (the one you've been working on while
Sally continues to work on <code class="filename">/trunk</code>).  It's a temporary
branch created to work on a complex change without interfering with the
stability of <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  Unlike release branches (which
may need to be supported forever), feature branches are born, used for a
while, merged back to the trunk, and then ultimately deleted.  They have a
finite span of usefulness.</p>
<p>Again, project policies vary widely concerning exactly when it's appropriate
to create a feature branch.  Some projects never use feature branches at
all: commits to <code class="filename">/trunk</code> are a free-for-all.  The
advantage to this system is that it's simple—nobody needs to learn
about branching or merging.  The disadvantage is that the trunk code is
often unstable or unusable.  Other projects use branches to an extreme: no
change is <span class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> committed to the trunk directly.  Even
the most trivial changes are created on a short-lived branch, carefully
reviewed, and merged to the trunk.  Then the branch is deleted.  This system
guarantees an exceptionally stable and usable trunk at all times, but at the
cost of tremendous process overhead.</p>
<p>Most projects take a middle-of-the-road approach.  They commonly insist that
<code class="filename">/trunk</code> compile and pass regression tests at all times.
A feature branch is required only when a change requires a large number of
destabilizing commits.  A good rule of thumb is to ask this question: if the
developer worked for days in isolation and then committed the large change
all at once (so that <code class="filename">/trunk</code> were never destabilized),
would it be too large a change to review? If the answer to that question is
“<span class="quote">yes,</span>” the change should be developed on a feature branch.  As
the developer commits incremental changes to the branch, they can be easily
reviewed by peers.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the issue of how to best keep a feature branch in
“<span class="quote">sync</span>” with the trunk as work progresses.  As we mentioned
earlier, there's a great risk to working on a branch for weeks or months;
trunk changes may continue to pour in, to the point where the two lines of
development differ so greatly that it may become a nightmare trying to merge
the branch back to the trunk.</p>
<p>This situation is best avoided by regularly merging trunk changes to the
branch.  Make up a policy: once a week, merge the last week's worth of trunk
changes to the branch.</p>
<p>At some point, you'll be ready to merge the “<span class="quote">synchronized</span>”
feature branch back to the trunk.  To do this, begin by doing a final merge
of the latest trunk changes to the branch.  When that's done, the latest
versions of branch and trunk will be absolutely identical except for your
branch changes.  You would then merge back with the
<code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ cd trunk-working-copy

$ svn update
At revision 1910.

$ svn merge --reintegrate ^/branches/mybranch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
U    real.c
U    integer.c
A    newdirectory
A    newdirectory/newfile
 U   .
…
</pre>
<p>Another way of thinking about this pattern is that your weekly sync of trunk
to branch is analogous to running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> in a working
copy, while the final merge step is analogous to running <span class="command"><strong>svn
commit</strong></span> from a working copy.  After all, what else
<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a working copy but a very shallow private branch?
It's a branch that's capable of storing only one change at a time.</p>
