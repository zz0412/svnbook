<p>现在你与Sally在同一个项目的并行分支上工作：你在私有分支上，而Sally在主干(<em class="firstterm">trunk</em>)或者叫做开发主线上。</p>
<p>For projects that have a large number of contributors, it's common for most
people to have working copies of the trunk.  Whenever someone needs to make
a long-running change that is likely to disrupt the trunk, a standard
procedure is to create a private branch and commit changes there until all
the work is complete.</p>
<p>So, the good news is that you and Sally aren't interfering with each other.
The bad news is that it's very easy to drift <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> far
apart.  Remember that one of the problems with the “<span class="quote">crawl in a
hole</span>” strategy is that by the time you're finished with your branch,
it may be near-impossible to merge your changes back into the trunk without
a huge number of conflicts.</p>
<p>Instead, you and Sally might continue to share changes as you work.  It's up
to you to decide which changes are worth sharing; Subversion gives you the
ability to selectively “<span class="quote">copy</span>” changes between branches.  And
when you're completely finished with your branch, your entire set of branch
changes can be copied back into the trunk.  In Subversion terminology, the
general act of replicating changes from one branch to another is called
<em class="firstterm">merging</em>, and it is performed using various
invocations of the <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command.</p>
<p>In the examples that follow, we're assuming that both your Subversion client
and server are running Subversion 1.5 (or later).  If either client or
server is older than version 1.5, things are more complicated: the system
won't track changes automatically, and you'll have to use painful manual
methods to achieve similar results.  That is, you'll always need to use the
detailed merge syntax to specify specific ranges of revisions to replicate
(see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.advanced.html#svn.branchmerge.advanced.advancedsyntax" title="4.4.2. 合并的语法：完整的描述">第 4.4.2 节 “合并的语法：完整的描述”</a> later in this
chapter), and take special care to keep track of what's already been merged
and what hasn't.  For this reason, we <span class="emphasis"><em>strongly</em></span>
recommend that you make sure your client and server are at least at version
1.5.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.changesets"></a>4.3.1. 变更集</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Before we proceed further, we should warn you that there's going to be a lot
of discussion of “<span class="quote">changes</span>” in the pages ahead.  A lot of people
experienced with version control systems use the terms “<span class="quote">change</span>”
and “<span class="quote">changeset</span>” interchangeably, and we should clarify what
Subversion understands as a <em class="firstterm">changeset</em>.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to have a slightly different definition of changeset, or at
least a different expectation of what it means for a version control system
to have one.  For our purposes, let's say that a changeset is just a
collection of changes with a unique name.  The changes might include textual
edits to file contents, modifications to tree structure, or tweaks to
metadata.  In more common speak, a changeset is just a patch with a name you
can refer to.</p>
<p>In Subversion, a global revision number N names a tree in the repository:
it's the way the repository looked after the Nth commit.  It's also the name
of an implicit changeset: if you compare tree N with tree N−1, you can
derive the exact patch that was committed.  For this reason, it's easy to
think of revision N as not just a tree, but a changeset as well.  If you use
an issue tracker to manage bugs, you can use the revision numbers to refer
to particular patches that fix bugs—for example, “<span class="quote">this issue was
fixed by r9238.</span>” Somebody can then run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn log -r
9238</code></strong> to read about the exact changeset that fixed the bug, and
run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn diff -c 9238</code></strong> to see the patch itself.  And
(as you'll see shortly)  Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command
is able to use revision numbers.  You can merge specific changesets from one
branch to another by naming them in the merge arguments: passing
<strong class="userinput"><code>-c 9238</code></strong> to <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> would merge
changeset r9238 into your working copy.</p>

<p>Continuing with our running example, let's suppose that a week has passed
since you started working on your private branch.  Your new feature isn't
finished yet, but at the same time you know that other people on your team
have continued to make important changes in the project's
<code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  It's in your best interest to replicate those
changes to your own branch, just to make sure they mesh well with your
changes.  In fact, this is a best practice: frequently keeping your branch
in sync with the main development line helps prevent “<span class="quote">surprise</span>”
conflicts when it comes time for you to fold your changes back into the
trunk.</p>
<p>Subversion is aware of the history of your branch and knows when it divided
away from the trunk.  To replicate the latest, greatest trunk changes to
your branch, first make sure your working copy of the branch is
“<span class="quote">clean</span>”—that it has no local modifications reported by
<span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.  Then simply run:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ pwd
/home/user/my-calc-branch

$ svn merge ^/trunk
--- Merging r345 through r356 into '.':
U    button.c
U    integer.c
</pre>
<p>This basic syntax—<strong class="userinput"><code>svn merge
<em class="replaceable"><code>URL</code></em></code></strong>—tells Subversion to merge
all recent changes from the URL to the current working directory (which is
typically the root of your working copy).  Also notice that we're using the
caret (<code class="literal">^</code>) syntax<sup>[<a name="id362684" href="#ftn.id362684" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup> to
avoid having to type out the entire <code class="filename">/trunk</code> URL.</p>
<p>After running the prior example, your branch working copy now contains new
local modifications, and these edits are duplications of all of the changes
that have happened on the trunk since you first created your branch:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status
 M     .
M      button.c
M      integer.c
</pre>
<p>At this point, the wise thing to do is look at the changes carefully with
<span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, and then build and test your branch.  Notice
that the current working directory (“<span class="quote"><code class="filename">.</code></span>”)
has also been modified; the <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> will show that its
<code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property has been either created or
modified.  This is important merge-related metadata that you should
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> touch, since it will be needed by future
<span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> commands.  (We'll learn more about this
metadata later in the chapter.)</p>
<p>After performing the merge, you might also need to resolve some conflicts
(just as you do with <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>) or possibly make some
small edits to get things working properly.  (Remember, just because there
are no <span class="emphasis"><em>syntactic</em></span> conflicts doesn't mean there aren't
any <span class="emphasis"><em>semantic</em></span> conflicts!)  If you encounter serious
problems, you can always abort the local changes by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
revert . -R</code></strong> (which will undo all local modifications) and start
a long “<span class="quote">what's going on?</span>” discussion with your collaborators.
If things look good, however, you can submit these changes into the
repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Merged latest trunk changes to my-calc-branch."
Sending        .
Sending        button.c
Sending        integer.c
Transmitting file data ..
Committed revision 357.
</pre>
<p>At this point, your private branch is now “<span class="quote">in sync</span>” with the
trunk, so you can rest easier knowing that as you continue to work in
isolation, you're not drifting too far away from what everyone else is
doing.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>为什么不使用补丁？</b></p>
<p>也许你的脑中会出现一个问题，特别如果你是Unix用户，为什么非要使用<span class="command"><strong>svn
merge</strong></span>？为什么不简单的使用操作系统的<span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span>命令来进行相同的工作？例如：</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn diff -r 341:HEAD ^/trunk &gt; patchfile
$ patch -p0  &lt; patchfile
Patching file integer.c using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 147.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 164.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 241.
Hunk #4 succeeded at 249.
done
</pre>
<p>In this particular example, there really isn't much difference.  But
<span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> has special abilities that surpass the
<span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program.  The file format used by
<span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> is quite limited; it's able to tweak file contents
only.  There's no way to represent changes to <span class="emphasis"><em>trees</em></span>,
such as the addition, removal, or renaming of files and directories.  Nor
can the <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program notice changes to properties.  If
Sally's change had, say, added a new directory, the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
diff</strong></span> wouldn't have mentioned it at all.  <span class="command"><strong>svn
diff</strong></span> outputs only the limited patch format, so there are some
ideas it simply can't express.</p>
<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command, however, can express changes in
tree structure and properties by directly applying them to your working
copy.  Even more important, this command records the changes that have been
duplicated to your branch so that Subversion is aware of exactly which
changes exist in each location (see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo" title="4.3.3. 合并信息和预览">第 4.3.3 节 “合并信息和预览”</a>.)  This is a critical
feature that makes branch management usable; without it, users would have to
manually keep notes on which sets of changes have or haven't been merged
yet.</p>
</div>
<p>Suppose that another week has passed.  You've committed more changes to your
branch, and your comrades have continued to improve the trunk as well.  Once
again, you'd like to replicate the latest trunk changes to your branch and
bring yourself in sync.  Just run the same merge command again!</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn merge ^/trunk
--- Merging r357 through r380 into '.':
U    integer.c
U    Makefile
A    README
</pre>
<p>Subversion knows which trunk changes you've already replicated to your
branch, so it carefully replicates only those changes you don't yet have.
Once again, you'll have to build, test, and <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>
the local modifications to your branch.</p>
<p>What happens when you finally finish your work, though? Your new feature is
done, and you're ready to merge your branch changes back to the trunk (so
your team can enjoy the bounty of your labor).  The process is simple.
First, bring your branch in sync with the trunk again, just as you've been
doing all along:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn merge ^/trunk
--- Merging r381 through r385 into '.':
U    button.c
U    README

$ # build, test, ...

Transmitting file data ..
Committed revision 390.
</pre>
<p>Now, you use <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to replicate your branch changes
back into the trunk.  You'll need an up-to-date working copy of
<code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  You can do this by either doing an
<span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>, dredging up an old trunk working copy from
somewhere on your disk, or using <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.switchwc.html" title="4.5. 使用分支">第 4.5 节 “使用分支”</a>.) However you get a trunk working copy,
remember that it's a best practice to do your merge into a working copy that
has <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> local edits and has been recently updated (i.e.,
is not a mixture of local revisions).  If your working copy isn't
“<span class="quote">clean</span>” in these ways, you can run into some unnecessary
conflict-related headaches and <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> will likely
return an error.</p>
<p>Once you have a clean working copy of the trunk, you're ready to merge your
branch back into it:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ pwd
/home/user/calc-trunk

$ svn update  # (make sure the working copy is up to date)

</pre>
<p>Congratulations, your branch has now been remerged back into the main line
of development.  Notice our use of the <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option
this time around.  The option is critical for reintegrating changes from a
branch back into its original line of development—don't forget it!
It's needed because this sort of “<span class="quote">merge back</span>” is a different
sort of work than what you've been doing up until now.  Previously, we had
been asking <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to grab the “<span class="quote">next set</span>”
of changes from one line of development (the trunk) and duplicate them to
another (your branch).  This is fairly straightforward, and each time
Subversion knows how to pick up where it left off.  In our prior examples,
you can see that first it merges the ranges 345:356 from trunk to branch;
later on, it continues by merging the next contiguously available range,
356:380.  When doing the final sync, it merges the range 380:385.</p>
<p>When merging your branch back to the trunk, however, the underlying
mathematics is quite different.  Your feature branch is now a mishmosh of
both duplicated trunk changes and private branch changes, so there's no
simple contiguous range of revisions to copy over.  By specifying the
<code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option, you're asking Subversion to carefully
replicate <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> those changes unique to your branch.
(And in fact, it does this by comparing the latest trunk tree with the
latest branch tree: the resulting difference is exactly your branch
changes!)</p>
<p>Now that your private branch is merged to trunk, you may wish to remove it
from the repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn delete ^/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Remove my-calc-branch."
Committed revision 392.
</pre>
<p>But wait! Isn't the history of that branch valuable? What if somebody wants
to audit the evolution of your feature someday and look at all of your
branch changes? No need to worry.  Remember that even though your branch is
no longer visible in the <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, its
existence is still an immutable part of the repository's history.  A simple
<span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> command on the <code class="filename">/branches</code> URL
will show the entire history of your branch.  Your branch can even be
resurrected at some point, should you desire (see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.resurrect" title="4.3.5. 找回删除的项目">第 4.3.5 节 “找回删除的项目”</a>).</p>
<p>In Subversion 1.5, once a <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> merge is done from
branch to trunk, the branch is no longer usable for further work.  It's not
able to correctly absorb new trunk changes, nor can it be properly
reintegrated to trunk again.  For this reason, if you want to keep working
on your feature branch, we recommend destroying it and then re-creating it
from the trunk:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Remove my-calc-branch."
Committed revision 392.

$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/new-branch
      -m "Create a new branch from trunk."
Committed revision 393.

$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn switch ^/branches/new-branch
Updated to revision 393.
</pre>
<p>The final command in the prior example—<span class="command"><strong>svn
switch</strong></span>—is a way of updating an existing working copy to
reflect a different repository directory.  We'll discuss this more in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.switchwc.html" title="4.5. 使用分支">第 4.5 节 “使用分支”</a>.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo"></a>4.3.3. 合并信息和预览</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The basic mechanism Subversion uses to track changesets—that is, which
changes have been merged to which branches—is by recording data in
properties.  Specifically, merge data is tracked in the
<code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property attached to files and
directories.  (If you're not familiar with Subversion properties, now is the
time to skim <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.html" title="3.2. 属性">第 3.2 节 “属性”</a>.)</p>
<p>你可以用与其它属性一样的方法，检查合并信息属性：</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:341-390
</pre>
<p>It is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> recommended that you change the value of this
property yourself, unless you really know what you're doing.  This property
is automatically maintained by Subversion whenever you run <span class="command"><strong>svn
merge</strong></span>.  Its value indicates which changes (at a given path) have
been replicated into the directory in question.  In this case, the path is
<code class="filename">/trunk</code> and the directory which has received the
specific changes is <code class="filename">/branches/my-calc-branch</code>.</p>
<p>There's also a subcommand, <span class="command"><strong>svn mergeinfo</strong></span>, which can be
helpful in seeing not only which changesets a directory has absorbed, but
also which changesets it's still eligible to receive.  This gives a sort of
preview of the next set of changes that <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> will
replicate to your branch.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch

# Which changes have already been merged from trunk to branch?
$ svn mergeinfo ^/trunk
r341
r342
r343
…
r388
r389
r390

# Which changes are still eligible to merge from trunk to branch?
$ svn mergeinfo ^/trunk --show-revs eligible
r391
r392
r393
r394
r395
</pre>
<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn mergeinfo</strong></span> command requires a
“<span class="quote">source</span>” URL (where the changes would be coming from), and
takes an optional “<span class="quote">target</span>” URL (where the changes would be
merged to).  If no target URL is given, it assumes that the current working
directory is the target.  In the prior example, because we're querying our
branch working copy, the command assumes we're interested in receiving
changes to <code class="filename">/branches/mybranch</code> from the specified trunk
URL.</p>
<p>Another way to get a more precise preview of a merge operation is to use the
<code class="option">--dry-run</code> option:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn merge ^/trunk --dry-run
U    integer.c

$ svn status
#  nothing printed, working copy is still unchanged.
</pre>
<p>The <code class="option">--dry-run</code> option doesn't actually apply any local
changes to the working copy.  It shows only status codes that
<span class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> be printed in a real merge.  It's useful for
getting a “<span class="quote">high-level</span>” preview of the potential merge, for
those times when running <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> gives too much detail.</p>

<p>Of course, the best way to preview a merge operation is to just do it!
Remember, running <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> isn't an inherently risky
thing (unless you've made local modifications to your working copy—but
we've already stressed that you shouldn't be merging into such an
environment).  If you don't like the results of the merge, simply run
<strong class="userinput"><code>svn revert . -R</code></strong> to revert the changes from your

final until you actually <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> the results.</p>

merge operation adds a new file (i.e., schedules it for addition),
<span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> won't actually remove the file; it simply
unschedules the addition.  You're left with an unversioned file.  If you
then attempt to run the merge again, you may get conflicts due to the
unversioned file “<span class="quote">being in the way.</span>” Solution? After performing
a revert, be sure to clean up the working copy and remove unversioned files

Committed revision 350.
</pre>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, one way to think about a repository revision is as
a specific changeset.  By using the <code class="option">-r</code> option, you can ask
<span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to apply a changeset, or a whole range of
changesets, to your working copy.  In our case of undoing a change, we're
asking <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to apply changeset #303 to our working
copy <span class="emphasis"><em>backward</em></span>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that rolling back a change like this is just like any other
<span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> operation, so you should use <span class="command"><strong>svn
status</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> to confirm that your work
is in the state you want it to be in, and then use <span class="command"><strong>svn
commit</strong></span> to send the final version to the repository.  After
committing, this particular changeset is no longer reflected in the
<code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.</p>
<p>Again, you may be thinking: well, that really didn't undo the commit, did
it? The change still exists in revision 303.  If somebody checks out a
version of the <code class="filename">calc</code> project between revisions 303 and
349, she'll still see the bad change, right?</p>
<p>Yes, that's true.  When we talk about “<span class="quote">removing</span>” a change,
we're really talking about removing it from the <code class="literal">HEAD</code>
revision.  The original change still exists in the repository's history.
For most situations, this is good enough.  Most people are only interested
in tracking the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> of a project anyway.  There are
special cases, however, where you really might want to destroy all evidence
of the commit.  (Perhaps somebody accidentally committed a confidential
document.)  This isn't so easy, it turns out, because Subversion was
deliberately designed to never lose information.  Revisions are immutable
trees that build upon one another.  Removing a revision from history would
cause a domino effect, creating chaos in all subsequent revisions and
possibly invalidating all working copies.  <sup>[<a name="id363449" href="#ftn.id363449" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup>

<p>The great thing about version control systems is that information is never
lost.  Even when you delete a file or directory, it may be gone from the
<code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision, but the object still exists in earlier
revisions.  One of the most common questions new users ask is, “<span class="quote">How do
I get my old file or directory back?</span>”</p>
<p>The first step is to define exactly <span class="emphasis"><em>which</em></span> item you're
trying to resurrect.  Here's a useful metaphor: you can think of every
object in the repository as existing in a sort of two-dimensional coordinate
system.  The first coordinate is a particular revision tree, and the second
coordinate is a path within that tree.  So every version of your file or
directory can be defined by a specific coordinate pair.  (Remember the
“<span class="quote">peg revision</span>” syntax—foo.c@224—mentioned back in
<a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.pegrevs.html" title="3.9. Peg 和实施修订版本">第 3.9 节 “Peg 和实施修订版本”</a>.) </p>
<p>First, you might need to use <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> to discover the
exact coordinate pair you wish to resurrect.  A good strategy is to run
<strong class="userinput"><code>svn log --verbose</code></strong> in a directory that used to contain
your deleted item.  The <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>)
option shows a list of all changed items in each revision; all you need to
do is find the revision in which you deleted the file or directory.  You can
do this visually, or by using another tool to examine the log output (via
<span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span>, or perhaps via an incremental search in an editor).</p>

Changed paths:
   D /calc/trunk/real.c
   M /calc/trunk/integer.c

Added fast fourier transform functions to integer.c.
Removed real.c because code now in double.c.
…
</pre>
<p>In the example, we're assuming that you're looking for a deleted file
<code class="filename">real.c</code>.  By looking through the logs of a parent
directory, you've spotted that this file was deleted in revision 808.
Therefore, the last version of the file to exist was in the revision right
before that.  Conclusion: you want to resurrect the path
<code class="filename">/calc/trunk/real.c</code> from revision 807.</p>
<p>That was the hard part—the research.  Now that you know what you want
to restore, you have two different choices.</p>
<p>One option is to use <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to apply revision 808
“<span class="quote">in reverse.</span>” (We already discussed how to undo changes in
<a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo" title="4.3.4. 取消修改">第 4.3.4 节 “取消修改”</a>.)  This would have the
effect of re-adding <code class="filename">real.c</code> as a local modification.
The file would be scheduled for addition, and after a commit, the file would
again exist in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>.</p>
<p>In this particular example, however, this is probably not the best
strategy.  Reverse-applying revision 808 would not only schedule
<code class="filename">real.c</code> for addition, but the log message indicates that
it would also undo certain changes to <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, which
you don't want.  Certainly, you could reverse-merge revision 808 and then
<span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> the local modifications to
<code class="filename">integer.c</code>, but this technique doesn't scale well.  What
if 90 files were changed in revision 808?</p>
<p>A second, more targeted strategy is not to use <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
at all, but rather to use the <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> command.  Simply
copy the exact revision and path “<span class="quote">coordinate pair</span>” from the
repository to your working copy:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn copy ^/trunk/real.c@807 ./real.c

$ svn status
A  +   real.c

$ svn commit -m "Resurrected real.c from revision 807, /calc/trunk/real.c."
Adding         real.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1390.
</pre>
<p>The plus sign in the status output indicates that the item isn't merely
scheduled for addition, but scheduled for addition “<span class="quote">with
history.</span>” Subversion remembers where it was copied from.  In the
future, running <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> on this file will traverse back
through the file's resurrection and through all the history it had prior to
revision 807.  In other words, this new <code class="filename">real.c</code> isn't
really new; it's a direct descendant of the original, deleted file.  This is
usually considered a good and useful thing.  If, however, you wanted to
resurrect the file <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> maintaining a historical
link to the old file, this technique works just as well:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn cat ^/trunk/real.c@807 &gt; ./real.c

$ svn add real.c
A         real.c

$ svn commit -m "Re-created real.c from revision 807."
Adding         real.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1390.
</pre>
<p>Although our example shows us resurrecting a file, note that these same
techniques work just as well for resurrecting deleted directories.  Also
note that a resurrection doesn't have to happen in your working
copy—it can happen entirely in the repository:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn copy ^/trunk/real.c@807 ^/trunk/ \
      -m "Resurrect real.c from revision 807."
Committed revision 1390.

$ svn update
A    real.c
Updated to revision 1390.
