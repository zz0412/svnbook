<p>Due largely to the simplicity of the overall design of the Subversion
repository and the technologies on which it relies, creating and configuring
a repository are fairly straightforward tasks.  There are a few preliminary
decisions you'll want to make, but the actual work involved in any given
setup of a Subversion repository is pretty basic, tending toward mindless
repetition if you find yourself setting up multiples of these things.</p>
<p>Some things you'll want to consider beforehand, though, are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>你的版本库将要存放什么数据(或多个版本库)，这些数据如何组织？</p></li>
<li><p>版本库存放在哪里，如何被访问？</p></li>
<li><p>你需要什么类型的访问控制和版本库事件报告？</p></li>
<li><p>你希望使用哪种数据存储方式？</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>在本节，我们要尝试帮你回答这些问题。</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"></a>5.2.1. 规划你的版本库结构</h3></div></div></div>
<p>While Subversion allows you to move around versioned files and directories
without any loss of information, and even provides ways of moving whole sets
of versioned history from one repository to another, doing so can greatly
disrupt the workflow of those who access the repository often and come to
expect things to be at certain locations.  So before creating a new
repository, try to peer into the future a bit; plan ahead before placing
your data under version control.  By conscientiously “<span class="quote">laying
out</span>” your repository or repositories and their versioned contents
ahead of time, you can prevent many future headaches.</p>
<p>Let's assume that as repository administrator, you will be responsible for
supporting the version control system for several projects.  Your first
decision is whether to use a single repository for multiple projects, or to
give each project its own repository, or some compromise of these two.</p>
<p>There are benefits to using a single repository for multiple projects, most
obviously the lack of duplicated maintenance.  A single repository means
that there is one set of hook programs, one thing to routinely back up, one
thing to dump and load if Subversion releases an incompatible new version,
and so on.  Also, you can move data between projects easily, without losing
any historical versioning information.</p>
<p>The downside of using a single repository is that different projects may
have different requirements in terms of the repository event triggers, such
as needing to send commit notification emails to different mailing lists, or
having different definitions about what does and does not constitute a
legitimate commit.  These aren't insurmountable problems, of course—it
just means that all of your hook scripts have to be sensitive to the layout
of your repository rather than assuming that the whole repository is
associated with a single group of people.  Also, remember that Subversion
uses repository-global revision numbers.  While those numbers don't have any
particular magical powers, some folks still don't like the fact that even
though no changes have been made to their project lately, the youngest
revision number for the repository keeps climbing because other projects are
actively adding new revisions.  <sup>[<a name="id367723" href="#ftn.id367723" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup>
      </p>
<p>A middle-ground approach can be taken, too.  For example, projects can be
grouped by how well they relate to each other.  You might have a few
repositories with a handful of projects in each repository.  That way,
projects that are likely to want to share data can do so easily, and as new
revisions are added to the repository, at least the developers know that
those new revisions are at least remotely related to everyone who uses that
repository.</p>
<p>After deciding how to organize your projects with respect to repositories,
you'll probably want to think about directory hierarchies within the
repositories themselves.  Because Subversion uses regular directory copies
for branching and tagging (see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.html" title="第 4 章 分支与合并">第 4 章 <i>分支与合并</i></a>), the
Subversion community recommends that you choose a repository location for
each <em class="firstterm">project root</em>—the “<span class="quote">topmost</span>”
directory that contains data related to that project—and then create
three subdirectories beneath that root: <code class="filename">trunk</code>, meaning
the directory under which the main project development occurs;
<code class="filename">branches</code>, which is a directory in which to create
various named branches of the main development line; and
<code class="filename">tags</code>, which is a collection of tree snapshots that are
created, and perhaps destroyed, but never changed.  <sup>[<a name="id367895" href="#ftn.id367895" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup>
        </p>
<p>For example, your repository might look like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   …
</pre>
<p>Note that it doesn't matter where in your repository each project root is.
If you have only one project per repository, the logical place to put each
project root is at the root of that project's respective repository.  If you
have multiple projects, you might want to arrange them in groups inside the
repository, perhaps putting projects with similar goals or shared code in
the same subdirectory, or maybe just grouping them alphabetically.  Such an
arrangement might look like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
/
   utils/
      calc/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      calendar/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      …
   office/
      spreadsheet/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      …
</pre>
<p>Lay out your repository in whatever way you see fit.  Subversion does not
expect or enforce a particular layout—in its eyes, a directory is a
directory is a directory.  Ultimately, you should choose the repository
arrangement that meets the needs of the people who work on the projects that
live there.</p>
<p>In the name of full disclosure, though, we'll mention another very common
layout.  In this layout, the <code class="filename">trunk</code>,
<code class="filename">tags</code>, and <code class="filename">branches</code> directories
live in the root directory of your repository, and your projects are in
subdirectories beneath those, like so:</p>
<pre class="screen">
/
   trunk/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
   tags/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
   branches/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
</pre>
<p>There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a layout, but it may or
may not seem as intuitive for your users.  Especially in large, multiproject
situations with many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only
one or two of the projects in the repository.  But the
projects-as-branch-siblings approach tends to deemphasize project
individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a single entity.
That's a social issue, though.  We like our originally suggested arrangement
for purely practical reasons—it's easier to ask about (or modify, or
migrate elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there's a
single repository path that holds the entire history—past, present,
tagged, and branched—for that project and that project alone.</p>

<a name="svn.reposadmin.basics.hosting"></a>5.2.2. 决定在哪里与如何部署你的版本库</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Before creating your Subversion repository, an obvious question you'll need
to answer is where the thing is going to live.  This is strongly connected
to myriad other questions involving how the repository will be accessed (via
a Subversion server or directly), by whom (users behind your corporate
firewall or the whole world out on the open Internet), what other services
you'll be providing around Subversion (repository browsing interfaces,
email-based commit notification, etc.), your data backup strategy, and so
on.</p>
<p>We cover server choice and configuration in <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.html" title="第 6 章 服务配置">第 6 章 <i>服务配置</i></a>, but the point we'd like to briefly make here is simply that the answers
to some of these other questions might have implications that force your
hand when deciding where your repository will live.  For example, certain
deployment scenarios might require accessing the repository via a remote
filesystem from multiple computers, in which case (as you'll read in the
next section) your choice of a repository backend data store turns out not
to be a choice at all because only one of the available backends will work
in this scenario.</p>
<p>Addressing each possible way to deploy Subversion is both impossible and
outside the scope of this book.  We simply encourage you to evaluate your
options using these pages and other sources as your reference material and
to plan ahead.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">

<p>Subversion provides two options for the type of underlying data
store—often referred to as “<span class="quote">the backend</span>” or, somewhat
confusingly, “<span class="quote">the (versioned) filesystem</span>”—that each
repository uses.  One type of data store keeps everything in a Berkeley DB
(or BDB) database environment; repositories that use this type are often
referred to as being “<span class="quote">BDB-backed.</span>” The other type stores data
in ordinary flat files, using a custom format.  Subversion developers have
adopted the habit of referring to this latter data storage mechanism as
<em class="firstterm">FSFS</em> <sup>[<a name="id368073" href="#ftn.id368073" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup> —a
versioned filesystem implementation that uses the native OS filesystem
directly—rather than via a database library or some other abstraction
layer—to store data.</p>

<br class="table-break"><p>There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these two backend types.
Neither of them is more “<span class="quote">official</span>” than the other, though the
newer FSFS is the default data store as of Subversion 1.2.  Both are
reliable enough to trust with your versioned data.  But as you can see in
<a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.tbl-1" title="表 5.1. 版本库数据存储对照表">表 5.1 “版本库数据存储对照表”</a>, the FSFS backend
provides quite a bit more flexibility in terms of its supported deployment
scenarios.  More flexibility means you have to work a little harder to find
ways to deploy it incorrectly.  Those reasons—plus the fact that not
using Berkeley DB means there's one fewer component in the
system—largely explain why today almost everyone uses the FSFS backend
when creating new repositories.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most programs that access Subversion repositories are
blissfully ignorant of which backend data store is in use.  And you aren't
even necessarily stuck with your first choice of a data store—in the
event that you change your mind later, Subversion provides ways of migrating
your repository's data into another repository that uses a different backend
data store.  We talk more about that later in this chapter.</p>
<p>下面的小节提供了数据存储类型更加详细的介绍。</p>
<div class="sect3" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.bdb"></a>5.2.3.1. Berkeley DB</h4></div></div></div>
<p>When the initial design phase of Subversion was in progress, the developers
decided to use Berkeley DB for a variety of reasons, including its open
source license, transaction support, reliability, performance, API
simplicity, thread safety, support for cursors, and so on.</p>
<p>Berkeley DB provides real transaction support—perhaps its most
powerful feature.  Multiple processes accessing your Subversion repositories
don't have to worry about accidentally clobbering each other's data.  The
isolation provided by the transaction system is such that for any given
operation, the Subversion repository code sees a static view of the
database—not a database that is constantly changing at the hand of
some other process—and can make decisions based on that view.  If the
decision made happens to conflict with what another process is doing, the
entire operation is rolled back as though it never happened, and Subversion
gracefully retries the operation against a new, updated (and yet still
static) view of the database.</p>
<p>Another great feature of Berkeley DB is <em class="firstterm">hot
backups</em>—the ability to back up the database environment
without taking it “<span class="quote">offline.</span>” We'll discuss how to back up your
repository later in this chapter (in <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.backup" title="5.4.8. 版本库备份">第 5.4.8 节 “版本库备份”</a>), but the benefits of being able to
make fully functional copies of your repositories without any downtime
should be obvious.</p>
<p>Berkeley DB is also a very reliable database system when properly used.
Subversion uses Berkeley DB's logging facilities, which means that the
database first writes to on-disk logfiles a description of any modifications
it is about to make, and then makes the modification itself.  This is to
ensure that if anything goes wrong, the database system can back up to a
previous <em class="firstterm">checkpoint</em>—a location in the logfiles
known not to be corrupt—and replay transactions until the data is
restored to a usable state.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace" title="5.4.3. 管理磁盘空间">第 5.4.3 节 “管理磁盘空间”</a> later in this chapter for more
about Berkeley DB logfiles.</p>
<p>But every rose has its thorn, and so we must note some known limitations of
Berkeley DB.  First, Berkeley DB environments are not portable.  You cannot
simply copy a Subversion repository that was created on a Unix system onto a
Windows system and expect it to work.  While much of the Berkeley DB
database format is architecture-independent, other aspects of the
environment are not.  Second, Subversion uses Berkeley DB in a way that will
not operate on Windows 95/98 systems—if you need to house a BDB-backed
repository on a Windows machine, stick with Windows 2000 or later.</p>
<p>While Berkeley DB promises to behave correctly on network shares that meet a
particular set of specifications, <sup>[<a name="id368427" href="#ftn.id368427" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup> most
networked filesystem types and appliances do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
actually meet those requirements.  And in no case can you allow a BDB-backed
repository that resides on a network share to be accessed by multiple
clients of that share at once (which quite often is the whole point of
having the repository live on a network share in the first place).</p>
<div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[警告]" src="images/warning.png"></td>
<th align="left">警告</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a noncompliant remote filesystem, the
results are unpredictable—you may see mysterious errors right away, or
it may be months before you discover that your repository database is subtly
corrupted.  You should strongly consider using the FSFS data store for
repositories that need to live on a network share.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Finally, because Berkeley DB is a library linked directly into Subversion,
it's more sensitive to interruptions than a typical relational database
system.  Most SQL systems, for example, have a dedicated server process that
mediates all access to tables.  If a program accessing the database crashes
for some reason, the database daemon notices the lost connection and cleans
up any mess left behind.  And because the database daemon is the only
process accessing the tables, applications don't need to worry about
permission conflicts.  These things are not the case with Berkeley DB,
however.  Subversion (and programs using Subversion libraries) access the
database tables directly, which means that a program crash can leave the
database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state.  When this
happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB to restore to a
checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance.  Other things can cause a
repository to “<span class="quote">wedge</span>” besides crashed processes, such as
programs conflicting over ownership and permissions on the database files.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">

<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[注意]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">注意</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Berkeley DB 4.4 brings (to Subversion 1.4 and later)  the ability for
Subversion to automatically and transparently recover Berkeley DB
environments in need of such recovery.  When a Subversion process attaches
to a repository's Berkeley DB environment, it uses some process accounting
mechanisms to detect any unclean disconnections by previous processes,
performs any necessary recovery, and then continues on as though nothing
happened.  This doesn't completely eliminate instances of repository
wedging, but it does drastically reduce the amount of human interaction
required to recover from them.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>So while a Berkeley DB repository is quite fast and scalable, it's best used
by a single server process running as one user—such as Apache's
<span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.html" title="第 6 章 服务配置">第 6 章 <i>服务配置</i></a>)—rather than accessing it as many
different users via <code class="literal">file://</code> or
<code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URLs.  If you're accessing a Berkeley DB
repository directly as multiple users, be sure to read <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.multimethod.html" title="6.6. 支持多种版本库访问方法">第 6.6 节 “支持多种版本库访问方法”</a> later in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs"></a>5.2.3.2. FSFS</h4></div></div></div>
<p>In mid-2004, a second type of repository storage system—one that
doesn't use a database at all—came into being.  An FSFS repository
stores the changes associated with a revision in a single file, and so all
of a repository's revisions can be found in a single subdirectory full of
numbered files.  Transactions are created in separate subdirectories as
individual files.  When complete, the transaction file is renamed and moved
into the revisions directory, thus guaranteeing that commits are atomic.
And because a revision file is permanent and unchanging, the repository also
can be backed up while “<span class="quote">hot,</span>” just like a BDB-backed
repository.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<a name="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs.revfiles"></a><p class="title"><b>Revision files and shards</b></p>
<p>FSFS repositories contain files that describe the changes made in a single
revision, and files that contain the revision properties associated with a
single revision.  Repositories created in versions of Subversion prior to
1.5 keep these files in two directories—one for each type of file.  As
new revisions are committed to the repository, Subversion drops more files
into these two directories—over time, the number of these files in
each directory can grow to be quite large.  This has been observed to cause
performance problems on certain network-based filesystems.</p>
<p>Subversion 1.5 creates FSFS-backed repositories using a slightly modified
layout in which the contents of these two directories are
<em class="firstterm">sharded</em>, or scattered across several subdirectories.
This can greatly reduce the time it takes the system to locate any one of
these files, and therefore increases the overall performance of Subversion
when reading from the repository.</p>
<p>Subversion 1.6 takes the sharded layout one step further, allowing
administrators to optionally <em class="firstterm">pack</em> each of their
repository shards up into a single multi-revision file.  This can have both
performance and disk usage benefits.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.fsfspacking" title="5.4.3.4. 打包 FSFS 文件系统">第 5.4.3.4 节 “打包 FSFS 文件系统”</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<p>The FSFS revision files describe a revision's directory structure, file
contents, and deltas against files in other revision trees.  Unlike a
Berkeley DB database, this storage format is portable across different
operating systems and isn't sensitive to CPU architecture.  Because no
journaling or shared-memory files are being used, the repository can be
safely accessed over a network filesystem and examined in a read-only
environment.  The lack of database overhead also means the overall
repository size is a bit smaller.</p>
<p>FSFS has different performance characteristics, too.  When committing a
directory with a huge number of files, FSFS is able to more quickly append
directory entries.  On the other hand, FSFS writes the latest version of a
file as a delta against an earlier version, which means that checking out
the latest tree is a bit slower than fetching the full-texts stored in a
Berkeley DB HEAD revision.  FSFS also has a longer delay when finalizing a
commit, which could in extreme cases cause clients to time out while waiting
for a response.</p>
<p>The most important distinction, however, is FSFS's imperviousness to wedging
when something goes wrong.  If a process using a Berkeley DB database runs
into a permissions problem or suddenly crashes, the database can be left in
an unusable state until an administrator recovers it.  If the same scenarios
happen to a process using an FSFS repository, the repository isn't affected
at all.  At worst, some transaction data is left behind.</p>
<p>The only real argument against FSFS is its relative immaturity compared to
Berkeley DB.  Unlike Berkeley DB, which has years of history, its own
dedicated development team, and, now, Oracle's mighty name attached to it,
<sup>[<a name="id368622" href="#ftn.id368622" class="footnote">32</a>]</sup> FSFS is a newer bit of engineering.
Prior to Subversion 1.4, it was still shaking out some pretty serious data
integrity bugs, which, while triggered in only very rare cases, nonetheless
did occur.  That said, FSFS has quickly become the backend of choice for
some of the largest public and private Subversion repositories, and it
promises a lower barrier to entry for Subversion across the board.</p>
