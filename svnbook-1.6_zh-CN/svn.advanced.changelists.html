<p>It is commonplace for a developer to find himself working at any given time
on multiple different, distinct changes to a particular bit of source code.
This isn't necessarily due to poor planning or some form of digital
masochism.  A software engineer often spots bugs in his peripheral vision
while working on some nearby chunk of source code.  Or perhaps he's halfway
through some large change when he realizes the solution he's working on is
best committed as several smaller logical units.  Often, these logical units
aren't nicely contained in some module, safely separated from other
changes.  The units might overlap, modifying different files in the same
module, or even modifying different lines in the same file.</p>
<p>Developers can employ various work methodologies to keep these logical
changes organized.  Some use separate working copies of the same repository
to hold each individual change in progress.  Others might choose to create
short-lived feature branches in the repository and use a single working copy
that is constantly switched to point to one such branch or another.  Still
others use <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> tools to
back up and restore uncommitted changes to and from patch files associated
with each change.  Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and to a
large degree, the details of the changes being made heavily influence the
methodology used to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Subversion 1.5 brings a new <em class="firstterm">changelists</em> feature that
adds yet another method to the mix.  Changelists are basically arbitrary
labels (currently at most one per file) applied to working copy files for
the express purpose of associating multiple files together.  Users of many
of Google's software offerings are familiar with this concept already.  For
example, <a class="ulink" href="http://mail.google.com/" target="_top">Gmail</a> doesn't provide
the traditional folders-based email organization mechanism.  In Gmail, you
apply arbitrary labels to emails, and multiple emails can be said to be part
of the same group if they happen to share a particular label.  Viewing only
a group of similarly labeled emails then becomes a simple user interface
trick.  Many other Web 2.0 sites have similar mechanisms—consider the
“<span class="quote">tags</span>” used by sites such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_top">YouTube</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_top">Flickr</a>, “<span class="quote">categories</span>”
applied to blog posts, and so on.  Folks understand today that organization
of data is critical, but that how that data is organized needs to be a
flexible concept.  The old files-and-folders paradigm is too rigid for some
applications.</p>
<p>Subversion's changelist support allows you to create changelists by applying
labels to files you want to be associated with that changelist, remove those
labels, and limit the scope of the files on which its subcommands operate to
only those bearing a particular label.  In this section, we'll look in
detail at how to do these things.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.changelists.creating"></a>3.10.1. 创建和更新修改列表</h3></div></div></div>
<p>You can create, modify, and delete changelists using the <span class="command"><strong>svn
changelist</strong></span> command.  More accurately, you use this command to set
or unset the changelist association of a particular working copy file.  A
changelist is effectively created the first time you label a file with that
changelist; it is deleted when you remove that label from the last file that
had it.  Let's examine a usage scenario that demonstrates these concepts.</p>
<p>Harry is fixing some bugs in the calculator application's mathematics
logic.  His work leads him to change a couple of files:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</pre>
<p>While testing his bug fix, Harry notices that his changes bring to light a
tangentially related bug in the user interface logic found in
<code class="filename">button.c</code>.  Harry decides that he'll go ahead and fix
that bug, too, as a separate commit from his math fixes.  Now, in a small
working copy with only a handful of files and few logical changes, Harry can
probably keep his two logical change groupings mentally organized without
any problem.  But today he's going to use Subversion's changelists feature
as a special favor to the authors of this book.</p>
<p>Harry first creates a changelist and associates with it the two files he's
already changed.  He does this by using the <span class="command"><strong>svn
changelist</strong></span> command to assign the same arbitrary changelist name to
those files:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-fixes integer.c mathops.c
Path 'integer.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'mathops.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-fixes'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</pre>
<p>就像你看到的，你的<span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>反映了新的分组。</p>
<p>Harry now sets off to fix the secondary UI problem.  Since he knows which
file he'll be changing, he assigns that path to a changelist, too.
Unfortunately, Harry carelessly assigns this third file to the same
changelist as the previous two files:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-fixes button.c
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-fixes'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
       button.c
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</pre>
<p>Fortunately, Harry catches his mistake.  At this point, he has two options.
He can remove the changelist association from <code class="filename">button.c</code>,
and then assign a different changelist name:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist --remove button.c
Path 'button.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'ui-fix'.
$
</pre>
<p>Or, he can skip the removal and just assign a new changelist name.  In this
case, Subversion will first warn Harry that <code class="filename">button.c</code> is
being removed from the first changelist:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
svn: warning: Removing 'button.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'ui-fix'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
       button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</pre>
<p>Harry now has two distinct changelists present in his working copy, and
<span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> will group its output according to these
changelist determinations.  Notice that even though Harry hasn't yet
modified <code class="filename">button.c</code>, it still shows up in the output of
<span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> as interesting because it has a changelist
assignment.  Changelists can be added to and removed from files at any time,
regardless of whether they contain local modifications.</p>
<p>现在 Harry 开始修正 <code class="filename">button.c</code> 中的用户界面问题。</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
M      button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</pre>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.changelists.asfilters"></a>3.10.2. 用修改列表作为操作过滤器</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The visual grouping that Harry sees in the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
status</strong></span> as shown in our previous section is nice, but not entirely
useful.  The <span class="command"><strong>status</strong></span> command is but one of many operations
that he might wish to perform on his working copy.  Fortunately, many of
Subversion's other operations understand how to operate on changelists via
the use of the <code class="option">--changelist</code> option.</p>
<p>When provided with a <code class="option">--changelist</code> option, Subversion
commands will limit the scope of their operation to only those files to
which a particular changelist name is assigned.  If Harry now wants to see
the actual changes he's made to the files in his
<code class="literal">math-fixes</code> changelist, he <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span>
explicitly list only the files that make up that changelist on the
<span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> command line.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn diff integer.c mathops.c
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c	(revision 1157)
+++ integer.c	(working copy)
…
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
…
$
</pre>
<p>That works okay for a few files, but what if Harry's change touched 20 or 30
files? That would be an annoyingly long list of explicitly named files.  Now
that he's using changelists, though, Harry can avoid explicitly listing the
set of files in his changelist from now on, and instead provide just the
changelist name:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn diff --changelist math-fixes
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c	(revision 1157)
+++ integer.c	(working copy)
…
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
…
$
</pre>
<p>And when it's time to commit, Harry can again use the
<code class="option">--changelist</code> option to limit the scope of the commit to
files in a certain changelist.  He might commit his user interface fix by
doing the following:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn ci -m "Fix a UI bug found while working on math logic." \
      --changelist ui-fix
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1158.
$
</pre>
<p>In fact, the <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command provides a second
changelists-related option: <code class="option">--keep-changelists</code>.  Normally,
changelist assignments are removed from files after they are committed.  But
if <code class="option">--keep-changelists</code> is provided, Subversion will leave
the changelist assignment on the committed (and now unmodified) files.  In
any case, committing files assigned to one changelist leaves other
changelists undisturbed.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</pre>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[注意]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">注意</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The <code class="option">--changelist</code> option acts only as a filter for
Subversion command targets, and will not add targets to an operation.  For
example, on a commit operation specified as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn commit
/path/to/dir</code></strong>, the target is the directory
<code class="filename">/path/to/dir</code> and its children (to infinite depth).  If
you then add a changelist specifier to that command, only those files in and
under <code class="filename">/path/to/dir</code> that are assigned that changelist
name will be considered as targets of the commit—the commit will not
include files located elsewhere (such is in
<code class="filename">/path/to/another-dir</code>), regardless of their changelist
assignment, even if they are part of the same working copy as the
operation's target(s).</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Even the <span class="command"><strong>svn changelist</strong></span> command accepts the
<code class="option">--changelist</code> option.  This allows you to quickly and easily
rename or remove a changelist:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-bugs --changelist math-fixes --depth infinity .
svn: warning: Removing 'integer.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'integer.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-bugs'.
svn: warning: Removing 'mathops.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'mathops.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-bugs'.
$ svn changelist --remove --changelist math-bugs --depth infinity .
Path 'integer.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
Path 'mathops.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
$
</pre>
<p>Finally, you can specify multiple instances of the
<code class="option">--changelist</code> option on a single command line.  Doing so
limits the operation you are performing to files found in any of the
specified changesets.</p>

<p>Subversion's changelist feature is a handy tool for grouping working copy
files, but it does have a few limitations.  Changelists are artifacts of a
particular working copy, which means that changelist assignments cannot be
propagated to the repository or otherwise shared with other users.
Changelists can be assigned only to files—Subversion doesn't currently
support the use of changelists with directories.  Finally, you can have at
most one changelist assignment on a given working copy file.  Here is where
the blog post category and photo service tag analogies break down—if
you find yourself needing to assign a file to multiple changelists, you're
out of luck.</p>
