<p>You may have noticed by now that Subversion is extremely flexible.  Because
it implements branches and tags with the same underlying mechanism
(directory copies), and because branches and tags appear in normal
filesystem space, many people find Subversion intimidating.  It's almost
<span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> flexible.  In this section, we'll offer some
suggestions for arranging and managing your data over time.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.maint.layout"></a>4.7.1. 版本库布局</h3></div></div></div>
<p>There are some standard, recommended ways to organize a repository.  Most
people create a <code class="filename">trunk</code> directory to hold the “<span class="quote">main
line</span>” of development, a <code class="filename">branches</code> directory to
contain branch copies, and a <code class="filename">tags</code> directory to contain
tag copies.  If a repository holds only one project, often people create
these top-level directories:</p>
<pre class="screen">
/trunk
/branches
/tags
</pre>
<p>如果一个版本库保存了多个项目，管理员会通过项目来布局(见<a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="5.2.1. 规划你的版本库结构">第 5.2.1 节 “规划你的版本库结构”</a>关于“<span class="quote">项目根目录</span>”)：</p>
<pre class="screen">
/paint/trunk
/paint/branches
/paint/tags
/calc/trunk
/calc/branches
/calc/tags
</pre>
<p>Of course, you're free to ignore these common layouts.  You can create any
sort of variation, whatever works best for you or your team.  Remember that
whatever you choose, it's not a permanent commitment.  You can reorganize
your repository at any time.  Because branches and tags are ordinary
directories, the <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> command can move or rename them
however you wish.  Switching from one layout to another is just a matter of
issuing a series of server-side moves; if you don't like the way things are
organized in the repository, just juggle the directories around.</p>
<p>Remember, though, that while moving directories may be easy to do, you need
to be considerate of your users as well.  Your juggling can be disorienting
to users with existing working copies.  If a user has a working copy of a
particular repository directory, your <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> operation
might remove the path from the latest revision.  When the user next runs
<span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, she will be told that her working copy
represents a path that no longer exists, and the user will be forced to
<span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> to the new location.
        </p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.maint.lifetime"></a>4.7.2. 数据的生命周期</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Another nice feature of Subversion's model is that branches and tags can
have finite lifetimes, just like any other versioned item.  For example,
suppose you eventually finish all your work on your personal branch of the
<code class="filename">calc</code> project.  After merging all of your changes back
into <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, there's no need for your private
branch directory to stick around anymore:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
             -m "Removing obsolete branch of calc project."

Committed revision 375.
</pre>
<p>And now your branch is gone.  Of course, it's not really gone: the directory
is simply missing from the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision, no longer
distracting anyone.  If you use <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>,
<span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>, or <span class="command"><strong>svn list</strong></span> to examine an
earlier revision, you'll still be able to see your old branch.</p>
<p>If browsing your deleted directory isn't enough, you can always bring it
back.  Resurrecting data is very easy in Subversion.  If there's a deleted
directory (or file) that you'd like to bring back into
<code class="literal">HEAD</code>, simply use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to copy it
from the old revision:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch@374 \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
           -m "Restore my-calc-branch."

Committed revision 376.
</pre>
<p>In our example, your personal branch had a relatively short lifetime: you
may have created it to fix a bug or implement a new feature.  When your task
is done, so is the branch.  In software development, though, it's also
common to have two “<span class="quote">main</span>” branches running side by side for
very long periods.  For example, suppose it's time to release a stable
version of the <code class="filename">calc</code> project to the public, and you know
it's going to take a couple of months to shake bugs out of the software.
You don't want people to add new features to the project, but you don't want
to tell all developers to stop programming either.  So instead, you create a
“<span class="quote">stable</span>” branch of the software that won't change much:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/stable-1.0 \
           -m "Creating stable branch of calc project."

Committed revision 377.
</pre>
<p>And now developers are free to continue adding cutting-edge (or
experimental) features to <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, and you can
declare a project policy that only bug fixes are to be committed to
<code class="filename">/calc/branches/stable-1.0</code>.  That is, as people continue
to work on the trunk, a human selectively ports bug fixes over to the stable
branch.  Even after the stable branch has shipped, you'll probably continue
to maintain the branch for a long time—that is, as long as you
continue to support that release for customers.  We'll discuss this more in
the next section.</p>
