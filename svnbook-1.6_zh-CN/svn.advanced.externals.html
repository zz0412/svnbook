<p>Sometimes it is useful to construct a working copy that is made out of a
number of different checkouts.  For example, you may want different
subdirectories to come from different locations in a repository or perhaps
from different repositories altogether.  You could certainly set up such a
scenario by hand—using <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> to create the
sort of nested working copy structure you are trying to achieve.  But if
this layout is important for everyone who uses your repository, every other
user will need to perform the same checkout operations that you did.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Subversion provides support for <em class="firstterm">externals
definitions</em>.  An externals definition is a mapping of a local
directory to the URL—and ideally a particular revision—of a
versioned directory.  In Subversion, you declare externals definitions in
groups using the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property.  You can create
or modify this property using <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn
propedit</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.html#svn.advanced.props.manip" title="3.2.2. 操作属性">第 3.2.2 节 “操作属性”</a>).  It
can be set on any versioned directory, and its value describes both the
external repository location and the client-side directory to which that
location should be checked out.</p>
<p>The convenience of the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is that
once it is set on a versioned directory, everyone who checks out a working
copy with that directory also gets the benefit of the externals definition.
In other words, once one person has made the effort to define the nested
working copy structure, no one else has to bother—Subversion will,
after checking out the original working copy, automatically also check out
the external working copies.</p>

</table></div>
<p>You also get in the externals definition design all the regular benefits of
Subversion properties.  The definitions are versioned.  If you need to
change an externals definition, you can do so using the regular property
modification subcommands.  When you commit a change to the
<code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property, Subversion will synchronize the
checked-out items against the changed externals definition when you next run
<strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong>.  The same thing will happen when others
update their working copies and receive your changes to the externals
definition.</p>

<p>Subversion releases prior to 1.5 honor an externals definition format that
is a multiline table of subdirectories (relative to the versioned directory
on which the property is set), optional revision flags, and fully qualified,
absolute Subversion repository URLs.  An example of this might look as
follows:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
third-party/sounds             http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds
third-party/skins -r148        http://svn.example.com/skinproj
third-party/skins/toolkit -r21 http://svn.example.com/skin-maker
</pre>
<p>注意前一个外部定义实例，当有人取出了一个<code class="filename">calc</code>目录的工作拷贝，Subversion会继续来取出外部定义的项目。</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc

A  calc/Makefile

A  calc/button.c

<p>As of Subversion 1.5, though, a new format of the
<code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is supported.  Externals
definitions are still multiline, but the order and format of the various
pieces of information have changed.  The new syntax more closely mimics the
order of arguments you might pass to <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>: the
optional revision flags come first, then the external Subversion repository
URL, and finally the relative local subdirectory.  Notice, though, that this
time we didn't say “<span class="quote">fully qualified, absolute Subversion repository
URLs.</span>” That's because the new format supports relative URLs and URLs
that carry peg revisions.  The previous example of an externals definition
might, in Subversion 1.5, look like the following:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
      http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
-r148 http://svn.example.com/skinproj third-party/skins
-r21  http://svn.example.com/skin-maker third-party/skins/toolkit
</pre>
<p>Or, making use of the peg revision syntax (which we describe in detail in
<a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.pegrevs.html" title="3.9. Peg 和实施修订版本">第 3.9 节 “Peg 和实施修订版本”</a>), it might appear as:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
http://svn.example.com/skinproj@148 third-party/skins
http://svn.example.com/skin-maker@21 third-party/skins/toolkit
</pre>
<div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip">

<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[提示]" src="images/tip.png"></td>
<th align="left">提示</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>You should seriously consider using explicit revision numbers in all of your
externals definitions.  Doing so means that you get to decide when to pull
down a different snapshot of external information, and exactly which
snapshot to pull.  Besides avoiding the surprise of getting changes to
third-party repositories that you might not have any control over, using
explicit revision numbers also means that as you backdate your working copy
to a previous revision, your externals definitions will also revert to the
way they looked in that previous revision, which in turn means that the
external working copies will be updated to match the way
<span class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> looked back when your repository was at that
previous revision.  For software projects, this could be the difference
between a successful and a failed build of an older snapshot of your complex
codebase.</p></td></tr>

<p>For most repositories, these three ways of formatting the externals
definitions have the same ultimate effect.  They all bring the same
benefits.  Unfortunately, they all bring the same annoyances, too.  Since
the definitions shown use absolute URLs, moving or copying a directory to
which they are attached will not affect what gets checked out as an external
(though the relative local target subdirectory will, of course, move with
the renamed directory).  This can be confusing—even
frustrating—in certain situations.  For example, say you have a
top-level directory named <code class="filename">my-project</code>, and you've
created an externals definition on one of its subdirectories
(<code class="filename">my-project/some-dir</code>) that tracks the latest revision
of another of its subdirectories
(<code class="filename">my-project/external-dir</code>).</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/projects .
A    my-project
A    my-project/some-dir
A    my-project/external-dir
…
Fetching external item into 'my-project/some-dir/subdir'
Checked out external at revision 11.

Checked out revision 11.
$ svn propget svn:externals my-project/some-dir
subdir http://svn.example.com/projects/my-project/external-dir

$
</pre>
<p>Now you use <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> to rename the
<code class="filename">my-project</code> directory.  At this point, your externals
definition will still refer to a path under the
<code class="filename">my-project</code> directory, even though that directory no
longer exists.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn move -q my-project renamed-project
$ svn commit -m "Rename my-project to renamed-project."
Deleting       my-project
Adding         renamed-project

Committed revision 12.
$ svn update

Fetching external item into 'renamed-project/some-dir/subdir'

$
</pre>
<p>Also, absolute URLs can cause problems with repositories that are available
via multiple URL schemes.  For example, if your Subversion server is
configured to allow everyone to check out the repository over
<code class="literal">http://</code> or <code class="literal">https://</code>, but only allow
commits to come in via <code class="literal">https://</code>, you have an interesting
problem on your hands.  If your externals definitions use the
<code class="literal">http://</code> form of the repository URLs, you won't be able to
commit anything from the working copies created by those externals.  On the
other hand, if they use the <code class="literal">https://</code> form of the URLs,
anyone who might be checking out via <code class="literal">http://</code> because his
client doesn't support <code class="literal">https://</code> will be unable to fetch
the external items.  Be aware, too, that if you need to reparent your
working copy (using <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> with the
<code class="option">--relocate</code> option), externals definitions will
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> also be reparented.</p>
<p>Subversion 1.5 takes a huge step in relieving these frustrations.  As
mentioned earlier, the URLs used in the new externals definition format can
be relative, and Subversion provides syntax magic for specifying multiple
flavors of URL relativity.</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">../</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Relative to the URL of the directory on which the
<code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is set</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">^/</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Relative to the root of the repository in which the
<code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is versioned</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">//</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Relative to the scheme of the URL of the directory on which the
<code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is set</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">/</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Relative to the root URL of the server on which the
<code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is versioned</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>So, looking a fourth time at our previous externals definition example, and
making use of the new absolute URL syntax in various ways, we might now see:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
^/sounds third-party/sounds
/skinproj@148 third-party/skins
//svn.example.com/skin-maker@21 third-party/skins/toolkit
</pre>
<p>The support that exists for externals definitions in Subversion remains less
than ideal, though.  An externals definition can point only to directories,
not to files.  Also, the local subdirectory part of the definition cannot
contain <code class="literal">..</code> parent directory indicators (such as
<code class="filename">../../skins/myskin</code>).  Perhaps most disappointingly, the
working copies created via the externals definition support are still
disconnected from the primary working copy (on whose versioned directories
the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property was actually set).  And
Subversion still truly operates only on nondisjoint working copies.  So, for
example, if you want to commit changes that you've made in one or more of
those external working copies, you must run <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>
explicitly on those working copies—committing on the primary working
copy will not recurse into any external ones.</p>
<p>We've already mentioned some of the additional shortcomings of the old
<code class="literal">svn:externals</code> format and how the new Subversion 1.5
format improves upon it.  But be careful when making use of the new format
that you don't inadvertently cause problems for other folks accessing your
repository who are using older Subversion clients.  While Subversion 1.5
clients will continue to recognize and support the original externals
definition format, older clients will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be able to
correctly parse the new format.</p>
<p>Besides the <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>,
<span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn export</strong></span> commands
which actually manage the <em class="firstterm">disjoint</em> (or disconnected)
subdirectories into which externals are checked out, the <span class="command"><strong>svn
status</strong></span> command also recognizes externals definitions.  It displays
a status code of <code class="literal">X</code> for the disjoint external
subdirectories, and then recurses into those subdirectories to display the
status of the external items themselves.  You can pass the
<code class="option">--ignore-externals</code> option to any of these subcommands to
disable externals definition processing.</p>
