<p>Both Apache and <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> are capable of granting (or
denying) permissions to users.  Typically this is done over the entire
repository: a user can read the repository (or not), and she can write to
the repository (or not).  It's also possible, however, to define
finer-grained access rules.  One set of users may have permission to write
to a certain directory in the repository, but not others; another directory
might not even be readable by all but a few special people.</p>
<p>Both servers use a common file format to describe these path-based access
rules.  In the case of Apache, one needs to load the
<span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> module and then add the
<code class="literal">AuthzSVNAccessFile</code> directive (within the
<code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file) pointing to your own rules file.  (For
a full explanation, see <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir" title="6.4.4.2. 每目录访问控制">第 6.4.4.2 节 “每目录访问控制”</a>.)  If you're using
<span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, you need to make the
<code class="literal">authz-db</code> variable (within
<code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code>) point to your rules file.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>你真的需要基于路径的访问控制吗？</b></p>
<p>A lot of administrators setting up Subversion for the first time tend to
jump into path-based access control without giving it a lot of thought.  The
administrator usually knows which teams of people are working on which
projects, so it's easy to jump in and grant certain teams access to certain
directories and not others.  It seems like a natural thing, and it appeases
the administrator's desire to maintain tight control of the repository.</p>
<p>Note, though, that there are often invisible (and visible!) costs associated
with this feature.  In the visible category, the server needs to do a lot
more work to ensure that the user has the right to read or write each
specific path; in certain situations, there's very noticeable performance
loss.  In the invisible category, consider the culture you're creating.
Most of the time, while certain users <span class="emphasis"><em>shouldn't</em></span> be
committing changes to certain parts of the repository, that social contract
doesn't need to be technologically enforced.  Teams can sometimes
spontaneously collaborate with each other; someone may want to help someone
else out by committing to an area she doesn't normally work on.  By
preventing this sort of thing at the server level, you're setting up
barriers to unexpected collaboration.  You're also creating a bunch of rules
that need to be maintained as projects develop, new users are added, and so
on.  It's a bunch of extra work to maintain.</p>
<p>Remember that this is a version control system! Even if somebody
accidentally commits a change to something she shouldn't, it's easy to undo
the change.  And if a user commits to the wrong place with deliberate
malice, it's a social problem anyway, and that the problem needs to be dealt
with outside Subversion.</p>
<p>So, before you begin restricting users' access rights, ask yourself whether
there's a real, honest need for this, or whether it's just something that
“<span class="quote">sounds good</span>” to an administrator.  Decide whether it's worth
sacrificing some server speed, and remember that there's very little risk
involved; it's bad to become dependent on technology as a crutch for social
problems.  <sup>[<a name="id378666" href="#ftn.id378666" class="footnote">49</a>]</sup>
      </p>
<p>As an example to ponder, consider that the Subversion project itself has
always had a notion of who is allowed to commit where, but it's always been
enforced socially.  This is a good model of community trust, especially for
open source projects.  Of course, sometimes there <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
truly legitimate needs for path-based access control; within corporations,
for example, certain types of data really can be sensitive, and access needs
to be genuinely restricted to small groups of people.</p>
</div>
<p>当你的服务器知道去查找规则文件时，就是需要定义规则的时候了。</p>
<p>The syntax of the file is the same familiar one used by
<code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> and the runtime configuration files.
Lines that start with a hash (<code class="literal">#</code>) are ignored.  In its
simplest form, each section names a repository and path within it, as well
as the authenticated usernames are the option names within each section.
The value of each option describes the user's level of access to the
repository path: either <code class="literal">r</code> (read-only) or
<code class="literal">rw</code> (read/write).  If the user is not mentioned at all, no
access is allowed.</p>
<p>To be more specific: the value of the section names is either of the form
<code class="literal">[repos-name:path]</code> or of the form
<code class="literal">[path]</code>.  If you're using the
<code class="literal">SVNParentPath</code> directive, it's important to specify the
repository names in your sections.  If you omit them, a section such as
<code class="literal">[/some/dir]</code> will match the path
<code class="filename">/some/dir</code> in <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> repository.  If
you're using the <code class="literal">SVNPath</code> directive, however, it's fine to
only define paths in your sections—after all, there's only one
repository.</p>
<pre class="screen">
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r
</pre>
<p>In this first example, the user <code class="literal">harry</code> has full read and
write access on the <code class="filename">/branches/calc/bug-142</code> directory in
the <code class="literal">calc</code> repository, but the user
<code class="literal">sally</code> has read-only access.  Any other users are blocked
from accessing this directory.</p>
<p>Of course, permissions are inherited from parent to child directory.  That
means we can specify a subdirectory with a different access policy for
Sally:</p>
<pre class="screen">
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

# give sally write access only to the 'testing' subdir
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/testing]
sally = rw
</pre>
<p>Now Sally can write to the <code class="filename">testing</code> subdirectory of the
branch, but can still only read other parts.  Harry, meanwhile, continues to
have complete read/write access to the whole branch.</p>
<p>也可以通过继承规则明确的的拒绝某人的访问，只需要设置用户名参数为空：</p>
<pre class="screen">
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/secret]
harry =
</pre>
<p>In this example, Harry has read/write access to the entire
<code class="filename">bug-142</code> tree, but has absolutely no access at all to
the <code class="filename">secret</code> subdirectory within it.</p>
<div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip">

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The thing to remember is that the most specific path always matches first.
The server tries to match the path itself, and then the parent of the path,
then the parent of that, and so on.  The net effect is that mentioning a

inherited from parent directories.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>By default, nobody has any access to the repository at all.  That means that
if you're starting with an empty file, you'll probably want to give at least
read permission to all users at the root of the repository.  You can do this
by using the asterisk variable (<code class="literal">*</code>), which means
“<span class="quote">all users</span>”:</p>
<pre class="screen">
[/]
* = r
</pre>
<p>This is a common setup; notice that no repository name is mentioned in the
section name.  This makes all repositories world-readable to all users. Once
all users have read access to the repositories, you can give explicit
<code class="literal">rw</code> permission to certain users on specific subdirectories
within specific repositories.</p>
<p>The asterisk variable (<code class="literal">*</code>) is also worth special mention
because it's the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> pattern that matches an anonymous
user.  If you've configured your server block to allow a mixture of
anonymous and authenticated access, all users start out accessing
anonymously.  The server looks for a <code class="literal">*</code> value defined for
the path being accessed; if it can't find one, it demands real
authentication from the client.</p>
<p>访问文件也允许你定义一组的用户，很像Unix的<code class="filename">/etc/group</code>文件：</p>
<pre class="screen">
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = harry, sally, joe, frank, sally, jane
</pre>
<p>Groups can be granted access control just like users.  Distinguish them with
an “<span class="quote">at</span>” (<code class="literal">@</code>) prefix:</p>
<pre class="screen">
[calc:/projects/calc]
@calc-developers = rw

[paint:/projects/paint]
jane = r
@paint-developers = rw
</pre>
<p>Another important fact is that the <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> matching rule
is the one which gets applied to a user.  In the prior example, even though
Jane is a member of the <code class="literal">paint-developers</code> group (which has
read/write access), the <code class="literal">jane = r</code> rule will be discovered
and matched before the group rule, thus denying Jane write access.</p>
<p>组中也可以定义为包含其它的组：</p>
<pre class="screen">
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
</pre>
<p>Subversion 1.5 brings another useful feature to the access file syntax:
username aliases.  Some authentication systems expect and carry relatively
short usernames of the sorts we've been describing
here—<code class="literal">harry</code>, <code class="literal">sally</code>,
<code class="literal">joe</code>, and so on.  But other authentication
systems—such as those which use LDAP stores or SSL client
certificates—may carry much more complex usernames.  For example,
Harry's username in an LDAP-protected system might be <code class="literal">CN=Harold
Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com</code>.  With usernames like that,
the access file can become quite bloated with long or obscure usernames that
are easy to mistype.  Fortunately, username aliases allow you to have to
type the correct complex username only once, in a statement which assigns to
it a more easily digestable alias.</p>
<pre class="screen">
[aliases]
harry = CN=Harold Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
sally = CN=Sally Swatterbug,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
joe = CN=Gerald I. Joseph,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
…
</pre>
<p>Once you've defined a set of aliases, you can refer to the users elsewhere
in the access file via their aliases in all the same places you could have
instead used their actual usernames.  Simply prepend an ampersand to the
alias to distinguish it from a regular username:</p>
<pre class="screen">
[groups]
calc-developers = &amp;harry, &amp;sally, &amp;joe
paint-developers = &amp;frank, &amp;sally, &amp;jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
</pre>
<p>You might also choose to use aliases if your users' usernames change
frequently.  Doing so allows you to need to update only the aliases table
when these username changes occur, instead of doing
global-search-and-replace operations on the whole access file.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>部分可读性和检出</b></p>
<p>If you're using Apache as your Subversion server and have made certain
subdirectories of your repository unreadable to certain users, you need to
be aware of a possible nonoptimal behavior with <span class="command"><strong>svn
checkout</strong></span>.</p>
<p>When the client requests a checkout or update over HTTP, it makes a single
server request and receives a single (often large) server response.  When
the server receives the request, that is the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
opportunity Apache has to demand user authentication.  This has some odd
side effects.  For example, if a certain subdirectory of the repository is
readable only by user Sally, and user Harry checks out a parent directory,
his client will respond to the initial authentication challenge as Harry.
As the server generates the large response, there's no way it can resend an
authentication challenge when it reaches the special subdirectory; thus the
subdirectory is skipped altogether, rather than asking the user to
reauthenticate as Sally at the right moment.  In a similar way, if the root
of the repository is anonymously world-readable, the entire checkout will be
done without authentication—again, skipping the unreadable directory,
rather than asking for authentication partway through.</p>
