<p>In any given working copy, there is a good chance that alongside all those
versioned files and directories are other files and directories that are
neither versioned nor intended to be.  Text editors litter directories with
backup files.  Software compilers generate intermediate—or even
final—files that you typically wouldn't bother to version.  And users
themselves drop various other files and directories wherever they see fit,
often in version control working copies.</p>
<p>It's ludicrous to expect Subversion working copies to be somehow impervious
to this kind of clutter and impurity.  In fact, Subversion counts it as a
<span class="emphasis"><em>feature</em></span> that its working copies are just typical
directories, just like unversioned trees.  But these not-to-be-versioned
files and directories can cause some annoyance for Subversion users.  For
example, because the <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
import</strong></span> commands act recursively by default and don't know which
files in a given tree you do and don't wish to version, it's easy to
accidentally add stuff to version control that you didn't mean to.  And
because <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> reports, by default, every item of
interest in a working copy—including unversioned files and
directories—its output can get quite noisy where many of these things
exist.</p>
<p>So Subversion provides two ways for telling it which files you would prefer
that it simply disregard.  One of the ways involves the use of Subversion's
runtime configuration system (see <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea" title="7.1. 运行配置区">第 7.1 节 “运行配置区”</a>),
and therefore applies to all the Subversion operations that make use of that
runtime configuration—generally those performed on a particular
computer or by a particular user of a computer.  The other way makes use of
Subversion's directory property support and is more tightly bound to the
versioned tree itself, and therefore affects everyone who has a working copy
of that tree.  Both of the mechanisms use <em class="firstterm">file
patterns</em> (strings of literal and special wildcard characters
used to match against filenames) to decide which files to ignore.</p>
<p>The Subversion runtime configuration system provides an option,
<code class="literal">global-ignores</code>, whose value is a whitespace-delimited
collection of file patterns.  The Subversion client checks these patterns
against the names of the files that are candidates for addition to version
control, as well as to unversioned files that the <span class="command"><strong>svn
status</strong></span> command notices.  If any file's name matches one of the
patterns, Subversion will basically act as if the file didn't exist at all.
This is really useful for the kinds of files that you almost never want to
version, such as editor backup files such as Emacs' <code class="literal">*~</code>
and <code class="literal">.*~</code> files.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Subversion 中的文件模式？</b></p>
<p>File patterns (also called <em class="firstterm">globs</em> or <em class="firstterm">shell
wildcard patterns</em>) are strings of characters that are intended
to be matched against filenames, typically for the purpose of quickly
selecting some subset of similar files from a larger grouping without having
to explicitly name each file.  The patterns contain two types of characters:
regular characters, which are compared explicitly against potential matches,
and special wildcard characters, which are interpreted differently for
matching purposes.</p>
<p>There are different types of file pattern syntaxes, but Subversion uses the
one most commonly found in Unix systems implemented as the
<code class="function">fnmatch</code> system function.  It supports the following
wildcards, described here simply for your convenience:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">?</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>匹配任意单个字符</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">*</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>匹配任意字符串，包括空字符串</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">[</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Begins a character class definition terminated by <code class="literal">]</code>, used
for matching a subset of characters</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>You can see this same pattern matching behavior at a Unix shell prompt.  The
following are some examples of patterns being used for various things:</p>

<p>When found on a versioned directory, the <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code>
property is expected to contain a list of newline-delimited file patterns
that Subversion should use to determine ignorable objects in that same
directory.  These patterns do not override those found in the
<code class="literal">global-ignores</code> runtime configuration option, but are
instead appended to that list.  And it's worth noting again that, unlike the
<code class="literal">global-ignores</code> option, the patterns found in the
<code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property apply only to the directory on which
that property is set, and not to any of its subdirectories.  The
<code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property is a good way to tell Subversion to
ignore files that are likely to be present in every user's working copy of
that directory, such as compiler output or—to use an example more
appropriate to this book—the HTML, PDF, or PostScript files generated
as the result of a conversion of some source DocBook XML files to a more
legible output format.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>CVS 用户的忽略模式</b></p>
<p>The Subversion <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property is very similar in
syntax and function to the CVS <code class="filename">.cvsignore</code> file.  In
fact, if you are migrating a CVS working copy to Subversion, you can
directly migrate the ignore patterns by using the
<code class="filename">.cvsignore</code> file as input file to the <span class="command"><strong>svn
propset</strong></span> command:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F .cvsignore .
property 'svn:ignore' set on '.'
$
</pre>
<p>There are, however, some differences in the ways that CVS and Subversion
handle ignore patterns.  The two systems use the ignore patterns at some
different times, and there are slight discrepancies in what the ignore
patterns apply to.  Also, Subversion does not recognize the use of the
<code class="literal">!</code> pattern as a reset back to having no ignore patterns at
all.</p>
</div>
<p>The global list of ignore patterns tends to be more a matter of personal
taste and ties more closely to a user's particular tool chain than to the
details of any particular working copy's needs.  So, the rest of this
section will focus on the <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property and its
uses.</p>
<p>假定你的<span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>有如下输出：</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
?      calc/debug_log
?      calc/debug_log.1
?      calc/debug_log.2.gz
?      calc/debug_log.3.gz
</pre>
<p>In this example, you have made some property modifications to
<code class="filename">button.c</code>, but in your working copy, you also have some
unversioned files: the latest <code class="filename">calculator</code> program that
you've compiled from your source code, a source file named
<code class="filename">data.c</code>, and a set of debugging output logfiles.  Now,
you know that your build system always results in the
<code class="filename">calculator</code> program being generated.  <sup>[<a name="id357651" href="#ftn.id357651" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup> And you know that your test suite always leaves
those debugging logfiles lying around.  These facts are true for all working
copies of this project, not just your own.  And you know that you aren't
interested in seeing those things every time you run <span class="command"><strong>svn
status</strong></span>, and you are pretty sure that nobody else is interested in
them either.  So you use <strong class="userinput"><code>svn propedit svn:ignore calc</code></strong>
to add some ignore patterns to the <code class="filename">calc</code> directory.  For
example, you might add this as the new value of the
<code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
calculator
debug_log*
</pre>
<p>After you've added this property, you will now have a local property
modification on the <code class="filename">calc</code> directory.  But notice what
else is different about your <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> output:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/data.c
</pre>
<p>Now, all that cruft is missing from the output! Your
<code class="filename">calculator</code> compiled program and all those logfiles are
still in your working copy; Subversion just isn't constantly reminding you
that they are present and unversioned.  And now with all the uninteresting
noise removed from the display, you are left with more intriguing
items—such as that source code file <code class="filename">data.c</code> that
you probably forgot to add to version control.</p>
<p>Of course, this less-verbose report of your working copy status isn't the
only one available.  If you actually want to see the ignored files as part
of the status report, you can pass the <code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option
to Subversion:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status --no-ignore
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
I      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
I      calc/debug_log
I      calc/debug_log.1
I      calc/debug_log.2.gz
I      calc/debug_log.3.gz
</pre>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the list of file patterns to ignore is also used by
<span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span>.  Both of these
operations involve asking Subversion to begin managing some set of files and
directories.  Rather than force the user to pick and choose which files in a
tree she wishes to start versioning, Subversion uses the ignore
patterns—both the global and the per-directory lists—to
determine which files should not be swept into the version control system as
part of a larger recursive addition or import operation.  And here again,
you can use the <code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option to tell Subversion
ignore its ignores list and operate on all the files and directories
present.</p>
<div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[提示]" src="images/tip.png"></td>
<th align="left">提示</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Even if <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> is set, you may run into problems if
you use shell wildcards in a command.  Shell wildcards are expanded into an
explicit list of targets before Subversion operates on them, so running
<strong class="userinput"><code>svn <em class="replaceable"><code>SUBCOMMAND</code></em> *</code></strong> is just
like running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn <em class="replaceable"><code>SUBCOMMAND</code></em> file1
file2 file3 …</code></strong>.  In the case of the <span class="command"><strong>svn
add</strong></span> command, this has an effect similar to passing the
<code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option.  So instead of using a wildcard, use
<strong class="userinput"><code>svn add --force .</code></strong> to do a bulk scheduling of
unversioned things for addition.  The explicit target will ensure that the
current directory isn't overlooked because of being already under version
control, and the <code class="option">--force</code> option will cause Subversion to
crawl through that directory, adding unversioned files while still honoring
the <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property and
<code class="literal">global-ignores</code> runtime configuration variable.  Be sure
to also provide the <code class="option">--depth files</code> option to the
<span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> command if you don't want a fully recursive crawl
for things to add.</p></td></tr>
