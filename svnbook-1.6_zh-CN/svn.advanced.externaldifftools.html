<p>The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way
differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only contextual
differencing capabilities were built around invocations of the GNU diffutils
toolchain, specifically the <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>diff3</strong></span> utilities.  To get the kind of behavior Subversion
needed, it called these utilities with more than a handful of options and
parameters, most of which were quite specific to the utilities.  Some time
later, Subversion grew its own internal differencing library, and as a
failover mechanism, the <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and
<code class="option">--diff3-cmd</code> options were added to the Subversion
command-line client so that users could more easily indicate that they
preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3 utilities instead of the newfangled
internal diff library.  If those options were used, Subversion would simply
ignore the internal diff library, and fall back to running those external
programs, lengthy argument lists and all.  And that's where things remain
today.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for folks to realize that having such easy configuration
mechanisms for specifying that Subversion should use the external GNU diff
and diff3 utilities located at a particular place on the system could be
applied toward the use of other differencing tools, too.  After all,
Subversion didn't actually verify that the things it was being told to run
were members of the GNU diffutils toolchain.  But the only configurable
aspect of using those external tools is their location on the
system—not the option set, parameter order, and so on.  Subversion
continues to throw all those GNU utility options at your external diff tool
regardless of whether that program can understand those options.  And that's
where things get unintuitive for most users.</p>
<p>The key to using external two- and three-way differencing tools (other than
GNU diff and diff3, of course) with Subversion is to use wrapper scripts,
which convert the input from Subversion into something that your
differencing tool can understand, and then to convert the output of your
tool back into a format that Subversion expects—the format that the
GNU tools would have used.  The following sections cover the specifics of
those expectations.</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The decision on when to fire off a contextual two- or three-way diff as part
of a larger Subversion operation is made entirely by Subversion and is
affected by, among other things, whether the files being operated on are
human-readable as determined by their <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
property.  This means, for example, that even if you had the niftiest
Microsoft Word-aware differencing or merging tool in the universe, it would
never be invoked by Subversion as long as your versioned Word documents had
a configured MIME type that denoted that they were not human-readable (such
as <code class="literal">application/msword</code>).  For more about MIME type
settings, see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. 文件内容类型">第 3.3.1 节 “文件内容类型”</a></p></td></tr>

<p>Subversion 1.5 introduces interactive resolution of conflicts (described in
<a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="2.4.5. 解决冲突(合并别人的修改)">第 2.4.5 节 “解决冲突(合并别人的修改)”</a>), and one of the options provided
to users is the ability to launch a third-party merge tool.  If this action
is taken, Subversion will consult the <code class="literal">merge-tool-cmd</code>
runtime configuration option to find the name of an external merge tool and,
upon finding one, will launch that tool with the appropriate input files.
This differs from the configurable three-way differencing tool in a couple
of ways.  First, the differencing tool is always used to handle three-way
differences, whereas the merge tool is employed only when three-way
difference application has detected a conflict.  Second, the interface is
much cleaner—your configured merge tool need only accept as
command-line parameters four path specifications: the base file, the
“<span class="quote">theirs</span>” file (which contains upstream changes), the
“<span class="quote">mine</span>” file (which contains local modifications), and the path
of the file where the final resolved contents should be stored.</p>

<p>Subversion calls external diff programs with parameters suitable for the GNU
diff utility, and expects only that the external program will return with a
successful error code.  For most alternative diff programs, only the sixth
and seventh arguments—the paths of the files that represent the left
and right sides of the diff, respectively—are of interest.  Note that
Subversion runs the diff program once per modified file covered by the
Subversion operation, so if your program runs in an asynchronous fashion (or
is “<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>”), you might have several instances of it all
running simultaneously.  Finally, Subversion expects that your program
return an error code of 1 if your program detected differences, or 0 if it
did not—any other error code is considered a fatal error.

<p>Subversion calls external merge programs with parameters suitable for the
GNU diff3 utility, expecting that the external program will return with a
successful error code and that the full file contents that result from the
completed merge operation are printed on the standard output stream (so that
Subversion can redirect them into the appropriate version-controlled file).
For most alternative merge programs, only the ninth, tenth, and eleventh
arguments, the paths of the files which represent the “<span class="quote">mine,</span>”
“<span class="quote">older,</span>” and “<span class="quote">yours</span>” inputs, respectively, are of
interest.  Note that because Subversion depends on the output of your merge
program, your wrapper script must not exit before that output has been
delivered to Subversion.  When it finally does exit, it should return an
error code of 0 if the merge was successful, or 1 if unresolved conflicts
remain in the output—any other error code is considered a fatal error.</p>
