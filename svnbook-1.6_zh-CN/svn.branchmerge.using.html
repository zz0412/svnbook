<p>At this point, you should understand how each commit creates an entirely new
filesystem tree (called a “<span class="quote">revision</span>”)  in the repository.  If
you don't, go back and read about revisions in <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.revs" title="1.3.3. 修订版本">第 1.3.3 节 “修订版本”</a>.</p>
<p>For this chapter, we'll go back to the same example from <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.html" title="第 1 章 基本概念">第 1 章 <i>基本概念</i></a>.  Remember that you and your collaborator, Sally, are
sharing a repository that contains two projects, <code class="filename">paint</code>
and <code class="filename">calc</code>.  Notice that in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1" title="图 4.2. 开始规划版本库">图 4.2 “开始规划版本库”</a>, however, each project directory now
contains subdirectories named <code class="filename">trunk</code> and
<code class="filename">branches</code>.  The reason for this will soon become clear.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>图 4.2. 开始规划版本库</b></p>
<div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch04dia2.png" alt="开始规划版本库"></div></div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>As before, assume that Sally and you both have working copies of the
“<span class="quote">calc</span>” project.  Specifically, you each have a working copy of
<code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  All the files for the project are in this
subdirectory rather than in <code class="filename">/calc</code> itself, because your
team has decided that <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> is where the
“<span class="quote">main line</span>” of development is going to take place.</p>
<p>Let's say that you've been given the task of implementing a large software
feature.  It will take a long time to write, and will affect all the files
in the project.  The immediate problem is that you don't want to interfere
with Sally, who is in the process of fixing small bugs here and there.
She's depending on the fact that the latest version of the project (in
<code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>) is always usable.  If you start committing
your changes bit by bit, you'll surely break things for Sally (and other
team members as well).</p>
<p>One strategy is to crawl into a hole: you and Sally can stop sharing
information for a week or two.  That is, start gutting and reorganizing all
the files in your working copy, but don't commit or update until you're
completely finished with the task.  There are a number of problems with
this, though.  First, it's not very safe.  Most people like to save their
work to the repository frequently, should something bad accidentally happen
to their working copy.  Second, it's not very flexible.  If you do your work
on different computers (perhaps you have a working copy of
<code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> on two different machines), you'll need to
manually copy your changes back and forth or just do all the work on a
single computer.  By that same token, it's difficult to share your changes
in progress with anyone else.  A common software development “<span class="quote">best
practice</span>” is to allow your peers to review your work as you go.  If
nobody sees your intermediate commits, you lose potential feedback and may
end up going down the wrong path for weeks before another person on your
team notices.  Finally, when you're finished with all your changes, you
might find it very difficult to remerge your final work with the rest of the
company's main body of code.  Sally (or others) may have made many other
changes in the repository that are difficult to incorporate into your
working copy—especially if you run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> after
weeks of isolation.</p>
<p>The better solution is to create your own branch, or line of development, in
the repository.  This allows you to save your half-broken work frequently
without interfering with others, yet you can still selectively share
information with your collaborators.  You'll see exactly how this works as
we go.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.using.create"></a>4.2.1. 创建分支</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Creating a branch is very simple—you make a copy of the project in the
repository using the <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> command.  Subversion is
able to copy not only single files, but whole directories as well.  In this
case, you want to make a copy of the <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>
directory.  Where should the new copy live? Wherever you wish—it's a
matter of project policy.  Let's say that your team has a policy of creating
branches in the <code class="filename">/calc/branches</code> area of the repository,
and you want to name your branch <code class="literal">my-calc-branch</code>.  You'll
want to create a new directory,
<code class="filename">/calc/branches/my-calc-branch</code>, which begins its life as
a copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.</p>
<p>You may already have seen <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> used to copy one file
to another within a working copy.  But it can also be used to do a
“<span class="quote">remote</span>” copy entirely within the repository.  Just copy one
URL to another:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Creating a private branch of /calc/trunk."

Committed revision 341.
</pre>
<p>This command causes a near-instantaneous commit in the repository, creating
a new directory in revision 341.  The new directory is a copy of
<code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  This is shown in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.create.dia-1" title="图 4.3. 版本库与复制">图 4.3 “版本库与复制”</a>.  <sup>[<a name="id362138" href="#ftn.id362138" class="footnote">20</a>]</sup> While it's also possible to create a branch by
using <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to duplicate a directory within the
working copy, this technique isn't recommended.  It can be quite slow, in
fact! Copying a directory on the client side is a linear-time operation, in
that it actually has to duplicate every file and subdirectory on the local
disk.  Copying a directory on the server, however, is a constant-time
operation, and it's the way most people create branches.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.using.create.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>图 4.3. 版本库与复制</b></p>

</div>
<br class="figure-break"><div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>廉价复制</b></p>
<p>Subversion's repository has a special design.  When you copy a directory,
you don't need to worry about the repository growing huge—Subversion
doesn't actually duplicate any data.  Instead, it creates a new directory
entry that points to an <span class="emphasis"><em>existing</em></span> tree.  If you're an
experienced Unix user, you'll recognize this as the same concept behind a
hard link.  As further changes are made to files and directories beneath the
copied directory, Subversion continues to employ this hard link concept
where it can.  It duplicates data only when it is necessary to disambiguate
different versions of objects.</p>
<p>This is why you'll often hear Subversion users talk about “<span class="quote">cheap
copies.</span>” It doesn't matter how large the directory is—it takes
a very tiny, constant amount of time and space to make a copy of it.  In
fact, this feature is the basis of how commits work in Subversion: each
revision is a “<span class="quote">cheap copy</span>” of the previous revision, with a few
items lazily changed within.  (To read more about this, visit Subversion's
web site and read about the “<span class="quote">bubble up</span>” method in Subversion's
design documents.)</p>
<p>Of course, these internal mechanics of copying and sharing data are hidden
from the user, who simply sees copies of trees.  The main point here is that
copies are cheap, both in time and in space.  If you create a branch
entirely within the repository (by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy
<em class="replaceable"><code>URL1</code></em>
<em class="replaceable"><code>URL2</code></em></code></strong>), it's a quick, constant-time
operation.  Make branches as often as you want.</p>

<p>There's nothing special about this working copy; it simply mirrors a
different directory in the repository.  When you commit changes, however,
Sally won't see them when she updates, because her working copy is of
<code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  (Be sure to read <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.switchwc.html" title="4.5. 使用分支">第 4.5 节 “使用分支”</a> later in this chapter: the <span class="command"><strong>svn

<p>Notice that Subversion is tracing the history of your branch's
<code class="filename">integer.c</code> all the way back through time, even
traversing the point where it was copied.  It shows the creation of the
branch as an event in the history, because <code class="filename">integer.c</code>
was implicitly copied when all of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk/</code> was
copied.  Now look at what happens when Sally runs the same command on her
copy of the file:</p>

<p>Sally sees her own revision 344 change, but not the change you made in
revision 343.  As far as Subversion is concerned, these two commits affected
different files in different repository locations.  However, Subversion
<span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> show that the two files share a common history.
Before the branch copy was made in revision 341, the files used to be the
same file.  That's why you and Sally both see the changes made in revisions
303 and 98.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.branchmerge.using.concepts"></a>4.2.3. 分支背后的关键概念</h3></div></div></div>
<p>You should remember two important lessons from this section.  First,
Subversion has no internal concept of a branch—it knows only how to
make copies.  When you copy a directory, the resultant directory is only a
“<span class="quote">branch</span>” because <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> attach that meaning
to it.  You may think of the directory differently, or treat it differently,
but to Subversion it's just an ordinary directory that happens to carry some
extra historical information.</p>
<p>Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's branches exist as
<span class="emphasis"><em>normal filesystem directories</em></span> in the repository.  This
is different from other version control systems, where branches are
typically defined by adding extra-dimensional “<span class="quote">labels</span>” to
collections of files.  The location of your branch directory doesn't matter
to Subversion.  Most teams follow a convention of putting all branches into
a <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, but you're free to invent any
policy you wish.</p>
