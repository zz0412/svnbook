<p>So far, we have only talked about conflicts at the level of file
content. When you and your collaborators make overlapping changes within the
same file, Subversion forces you to merge those changes before you can
commit.<sup>[<a name="id354919" href="#ftn.id354919" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup></p>
<p>But what happens if your collaborators move or delete a file that you are
still working on? Maybe there was a miscommunication, and one person thinks
the file should be deleted, while another person still wants to commit
changes to the file. Or maybe your collaborators did some refactoring,
renaming files and moving around directories in the process. If you were
still working on these files, those modifications may need to be applied to
the files at their new location. Such conflicts manifest themselves at the
directory tree structure level rather than at the file content level, and
are known as <em class="firstterm">tree conflicts</em>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Subversion 1.6 之前的树冲突</b></p>
<p>Prior to Subversion 1.6, tree conflicts could yield rather unexpected
results. For example, if a file was locally modified, but had been renamed
in the repository, running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> would make
Subversion carry out the following steps:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Check the file to be renamed for local modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the file at its old location, and if it had local modifications, keep
an on-disk copy of the file at the old location. This on-disk copy now
appears as an unversioned file in the working copy.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the file, as it exists in the repository, at its new location.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>When this situation arises, there is the possibility that the user makes a
commit without realizing that local modifications have been left in a
now-unversioned file in the working copy, and have not reached the
repository.  This gets more and more likely (and tedious) if the number of
files affected by this problem is large.</p>
<p>Since Subversion 1.6, this and other similar situations are flagged as
conflicts in the working copy.</p>
</div>
<p>As with textual conflicts, tree conflicts prevent a commit from being made
from the conflicted state, giving the user the opportunity to examine the
state of the working copy for potential problems arising from the tree
conflict, and resolving any such problems before committing.</p>

</pre>
<p>Your collaborator Harry has renamed the file <code class="filename">bar.c</code> to
<code class="filename">baz.c</code>.  You are still working on
<code class="filename">bar.c</code> in your working copy, but you don't know yet that
the file has been renamed in the repository.</p>

<p>At this point, you need to run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>.  Besides
bringing our working copy up to date so that you can see Harry's changes,
this also flags a tree conflict so you have the opportunity to evaluate and
properly resolve it.</p>

Updated to revision 5.
Summary of conflicts:
  Tree conflicts: 1
</pre>
<p>In its output, <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> signifies tree conflicts using
a capital C in the fourth output column.  <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>
reveals additional details of the conflict:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M       code/foo.c
A  +  C code/bar.c
      &gt;   local edit, incoming delete upon update
M       code/baz.c
</pre>
<p>Note how bar.c is automatically scheduled for re-addition in your working
copy, which simplifies things in case you want to keep the file.</p>
<p>Because a move in Subversion is implemented as a copy operation followed by
a delete operation, and these two operations cannot be easily related to one
another during an update, all Subversion can warn you about is an incoming
delete operation on a locally modified file.  This delete operation
<span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be part of a move, or it could be a genuine delete
operation. Talking to your collaborators, or, as a last resort, <span class="command"><strong>svn
log</strong></span>, is a good way to find out what has actually happened.</p>
<p>Both <code class="filename">foo.c</code> and <code class="filename">baz.c</code> are reported
as locally modified in the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.  You
made the changes to <code class="filename">foo.c</code> yourself, so this should not
be surprising. But why is <code class="filename">baz.c</code> reported as locally
modified?</p>
<p>
        The answer is that despite the limitations of the move implementation,
Subversion was smart enough to transfer your local edits in
<code class="filename">bar.c</code> into <code class="filename">baz.c</code>:</p>
