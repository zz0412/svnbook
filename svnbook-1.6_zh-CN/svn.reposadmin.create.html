<p>Earlier in this chapter (in <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.planning.html" title="5.2. 版本库开发策略">第 5.2 节 “版本库开发策略”</a>), we
looked at some of the important decisions that should be made before
creating and configuring your Subversion repository.  Now, we finally get to
get our hands dirty! In this section, we'll see how to actually create a
Subversion repository and configure it to perform custom actions when
special repository events occur.</p>

<p>Subversion repository creation is an incredibly simple task.  The
<span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span> utility that comes with Subversion provides a
subcommand (<span class="command"><strong>svnadmin create</strong></span>) for doing just that.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ # Create a repository
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/repos
$
</pre>
<p>This creates a new repository in the directory
<code class="filename">/var/svn/repos</code>, and with the default filesystem data
store.  Prior to Subversion 1.2, the default was to use Berkeley DB; the
default is now FSFS.  You can explicitly choose the filesystem type using
the <code class="option">--fs-type</code> argument, which accepts as a parameter either
<code class="literal">fsfs</code> or <code class="literal">bdb</code>.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ # Create an FSFS-backed repository
$ svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs /var/svn/repos
$
</pre>
<pre class="screen">
# Create a Berkeley-DB-backed repository
$ svnadmin create --fs-type bdb /var/svn/repos
$
</pre>
<p>运行这个命令之后，你有了一个Subversion版本库。</p>

<a name="svn.reposadmin.create.hooks"></a>5.3.2. 实现版本库钩子</h3></div></div></div>
<p>A <em class="firstterm">hook</em> is a program triggered by some repository
event, such as the creation of a new revision or the modification of an
unversioned property.  Some hooks (the so-called “<span class="quote">pre hooks</span>”)
run in advance of a repository operation and provide a means by which to
both report what is about to happen and prevent it from happening at all.
Other hooks (the “<span class="quote">post hooks</span>”)  run after the completion of a
repository event and are useful for performing tasks that examine—but
don't modify—the repository.  Each hook is handed enough information
to tell what that event is (or was), the specific repository changes
proposed (or completed), and the username of the person who triggered the
event.</p>
<p>默认情况下，<code class="filename">hooks</code>子目录中包含各种版本库钩子模板。</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ ls repos/hooks/
post-commit.tmpl          post-unlock.tmpl  pre-revprop-change.tmpl
post-lock.tmpl            pre-commit.tmpl   pre-unlock.tmpl
post-revprop-change.tmpl  pre-lock.tmpl     start-commit.tmpl
$
</pre>
<p>There is one template for each hook that the Subversion repository supports;
by examining the contents of those template scripts, you can see what
triggers each script to run and what data is passed to that script.  Also
present in many of these templates are examples of how one might use that
script, in conjunction with other Subversion-supplied programs, to perform
common useful tasks.  To actually install a working hook, you need only
place some executable program or script into the
<code class="filename">repos/hooks</code> directory, which can be executed as the
name (such as <span class="command"><strong>start-commit</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>post-commit</strong></span>) of the hook.</p>
<p>On Unix platforms, this means supplying a script or program (which could be
a shell script, a Python program, a compiled C binary, or any number of
other things) named exactly like the name of the hook.  Of course, the
template files are present for more than just informational
purposes—the easiest way to install a hook on Unix platforms is to
simply copy the appropriate template file to a new file that lacks the
<code class="filename">.tmpl</code> extension, customize the hook's contents, and
ensure that the script is executable.  Windows, however, uses file
extensions to determine whether a program is executable, so you would need
to supply a program whose basename is the name of the hook and whose
extension is one of the special extensions recognized by Windows for
executable programs, such as <code class="filename">.exe</code> for programs and
<code class="filename">.bat</code> for batch files.</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>For security reasons, the Subversion repository executes hook programs with
an empty environment—that is, no environment variables are set at all,
not even <code class="literal">$PATH</code> (or <code class="literal">%PATH%</code>, under
Windows).  Because of this, many administrators are baffled when their hook
program runs fine by hand, but doesn't work when run by Subversion.  Be sure
to explicitly set any necessary environment variables in your hook program
and/or use absolute paths to programs.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Subversion executes hooks as the same user who owns the process that is
accessing the Subversion repository.  In most cases, the repository is being
accessed via a Subversion server, so this user is the same user as whom the
server runs on the system.  The hooks themselves will need to be configured
with OS-level permissions that allow that user to execute them.  Also, this
means that any programs or files (including the Subversion repository)
accessed directly or indirectly by the hook will be accessed as the same
user.  In other words, be alert to potential permission-related problems
that could prevent the hook from performing the tasks it is designed to
perform.</p>
<p>There are serveral hooks implemented by the Subversion repository, and you
can get details about each of them in <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.reposhooks.html" title="9.11. 版本库钩子">第 9.11 节 “版本库钩子”</a>.  As a repository administrator, you'll need to decide which hooks you
wish to implement (by way of providing an appropriately named and
permissioned hook program), and how.  When you make this decision, keep in
mind the big picture of how your repository is deployed.  For example, if
you are using server configuration to determine which users are permitted to
commit changes to your repository, you don't need to do this sort of access
control via the hook system.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of Subversion hook programs and scripts that are freely
available either from the Subversion community itself or elsewhere.  These
scripts cover a wide range of utility—basic access control, policy
adherence checking, issue tracker integration, email- or syndication-based
commit notification, and beyond.  Or, if you wish to write your own, see

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While hook scripts can do almost anything, there is one dimension in which

modify a commit transaction using hook scripts.  While it might be tempting
to use hook scripts to automatically correct errors, shortcomings, or policy
violations present in the files being committed, doing so can cause
problems.  Subversion keeps client-side caches of certain bits of repository
data, and if you change a commit transaction in this way, those caches
become indetectably stale.  This inconsistency can lead to surprising and
unexpected behavior.  Instead of modifying the transaction, you should
simply <span class="emphasis"><em>validate</em></span> the transaction in the
<code class="filename">pre-commit</code> hook and reject the commit if it does not
meet the desired requirements.  As a bonus, your users will learn the value
of careful, compliance-minded work habits.</p></td></tr>

<a name="svn.reposadmin.create.bdb"></a>5.3.3. Berkeley DB 配置</h3></div></div></div>
<p>A Berkeley DB environment is an encapsulation of one or more databases,
logfiles, region files, and configuration files.  The Berkeley DB
environment has its own set of default configuration values for things such
as the number of database locks allowed to be taken out at any given time,
the maximum size of the journaling logfiles, and so on.  Subversion's
filesystem logic additionally chooses default values for some of the
Berkeley DB configuration options.  However, sometimes your particular
repository, with its unique collection of data and access patterns, might
require a different set of configuration option values.</p>
<p>The producers of Berkeley DB understand that different applications and
database environments have different requirements, so they have provided a
mechanism for overriding at runtime many of the configuration values for the
Berkeley DB environment.  BDB checks for the presence of a file named
<code class="filename">DB_CONFIG</code> in the environment directory (namely, the
repository's <code class="filename">db</code> subdirectory), and parses the options
found in that file.  Subversion itself creates this file when it creates the
rest of the repository.  The file initially contains some default options,
as well as pointers to the Berkeley DB online documentation so that you can
read about what those options do.  Of course, you are free to add any of the
supported Berkeley DB options to your <code class="filename">DB_CONFIG</code> file.
Just be aware that while Subversion never attempts to read or interpret the
contents of the file and makes no direct use of the option settings in it,
you'll want to avoid any configuration changes that may cause Berkeley DB to
behave in a fashion that is at odds with what Subversion might expect.
Also, changes made to <code class="filename">DB_CONFIG</code> won't take effect until
you recover the database environment (using <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
recover</strong></span>).</p>

<p>As of Subversion 1.6, FSFS filesystems have several configurable parameters
which an administrator can use to fine-tune the performance or disk usage of
their repositories.  You can find these options—and the documentation
for them—in the <code class="filename">db/fsfs.conf</code> file in the
repository.</p>
