<p>We copy, move, rename, and completely replace files and directories on our
computers all the time.  And your version control system shouldn't get in
the way of your doing these things with your version-controlled files and
directories, either.  Subversion's file management support is quite
liberating, affording almost as much flexibility for versioned files as
you'd expect when manipulating your unversioned ones.  But that flexibility
means that across the lifetime of your repository, a given versioned object
might have many paths, and a given path might represent several entirely
different versioned objects.  This introduces a certain level of complexity
to your interactions with those paths and objects.</p>
<p>Subversion is pretty smart about noticing when an object's version history
includes such “<span class="quote">changes of address.</span>” For example, if you ask for
the revision history log of a particular file that was renamed last week,
Subversion happily provides all those logs—the revision in which the
rename itself happened, plus the logs of relevant revisions both before and
after that rename.  So, most of the time, you don't even have to think about
such things.  But occasionally, Subversion needs your help to clear up
ambiguities.</p>
<p>The simplest example of this occurs when a directory or file is deleted from
version control, and then a new directory or file is created with the same
name and added to version control.  The thing you deleted and the thing you
later added aren't the same thing.  They merely happen to have had the same
path—<code class="filename">/trunk/object</code>, for example.  What, then,
does it mean to ask Subversion about the history of
<code class="filename">/trunk/object</code>? Are you asking about the thing currently
at that location, or the old thing you deleted from that location? Are you
asking about the operations that have happened to <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
the objects that have ever lived at that path? Subversion needs a hint about
what you really want.</p>
<p>And thanks to moves, versioned object history can get far more twisted than
even that.  For example, you might have a directory named
<code class="filename">concept</code>, containing some nascent software project
you've been toying with.  Eventually, though, that project matures to the
point that the idea seems to actually have some wings, so you do the
unthinkable and decide to give the project a name.  <sup>[<a name="id360355" href="#ftn.id360355" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup> Let's say you called your software
Frabnaggilywort.  At this point, it makes sense to rename the directory to
reflect the project's new name, so <code class="filename">concept</code> is renamed
to <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code>.  Life goes on, Frabnaggilywort
releases a 1.0 version and is downloaded and used daily by hordes of people
aiming to improve their lives.</p>
<p>It's a nice story, really, but it doesn't end there.  Entrepreneur that you
are, you've already got another think in the tank.  So you make a new
directory, <code class="filename">concept</code>, and the cycle begins again.  In
fact, the cycle begins again many times over the years, each time starting
with that old <code class="filename">concept</code> directory, then sometimes seeing
that directory renamed as the idea cures, sometimes seeing it deleted when
you scrap the idea.  Or, to get really sick, maybe you rename
<code class="filename">concept</code> to something else for a while, but later rename
the thing back to <code class="filename">concept</code> for some reason.</p>
<p>In scenarios like these, attempting to instruct Subversion to work with
these reused paths can be a little like instructing a motorist in Chicago's
West Suburbs to drive east down Roosevelt Road and turn left onto Main
Street.  In a mere 20 minutes, you can cross “<span class="quote">Main Street</span>” in
Wheaton, Glen Ellyn, and Lombard.  And no, they aren't the same street.  Our
motorist—and our Subversion—need a little more detail to do the
right thing.</p>
<p>In version 1.1, Subversion introduced a way for you to tell it exactly which
Main Street you meant.  It's called the <em class="firstterm">peg revision</em>,
and it is provided to Subversion for the sole purpose of identifying a
unique line of history.  Because at most, one versioned object may occupy a
path at any given time—or, more precisely, in any one
revision—the combination of a path and a peg revision is all that is
needed to refer to a specific line of history.  Peg revisions are specified
to the Subversion command-line client using <em class="firstterm">at
syntax</em>, so called because the syntax involves appending an
“<span class="quote">at sign</span>” (<code class="literal">@</code>) and the peg revision to the
end of the path with which the revision is associated.</p>
<p>But what of the <code class="option">--revision</code> (<code class="option">-r</code>) of which
we've spoken so much in this book? That revision (or set of revisions) is
called the <em class="firstterm">operative revision</em> (or
<em class="firstterm">operative revision range</em>).  Once a particular line of
history has been identified using a path and peg revision, Subversion
performs the requested operation using the operative revision(s).  To map
this to our Chicagoland streets analogy, if we are told to go to 606 N. Main
Street in Wheaton, <sup>[<a name="id360459" href="#ftn.id360459" class="footnote">18</a>]</sup> we can think of
“<span class="quote">Main Street</span>” as our path and “<span class="quote">Wheaton</span>” as our peg
revision.  These two pieces of information identify a unique path that can
be traveled (north or south on Main Street), and they keep us from traveling
up and down the wrong Main Street in search of our destination.  Now we
throw in “<span class="quote">606 N.</span>” as our operative revision of sorts, and we
know <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> where to go.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Peg 修订版本算法</b></p>
<p>The Subversion command-line client performs the peg revision algorithm any
time it needs to resolve possible ambiguities in the paths and revisions
provided to it.  Here's an example of such an invocation:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn <em class="replaceable"><code>command</code></em> -r <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> item@<em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>
</pre>
<p>If <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> is older than
<em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>, the algorithm is as follows:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>Locate <em class="replaceable"><code>item</code></em> in the revision identified by
<em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>.  There can be only one such object.</p></li>
<li><p>追踪对象的历史背景(通过任何可能的改名)来到修订版本<em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>的祖先。</p></li>
<li><p>Perform the requested action on that ancestor, wherever it is located, or
whatever its name might be or might have been at that time.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>But what if <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> is
<span class="emphasis"><em>younger</em></span> than <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>? Well,
that adds some complexity to the theoretical problem of locating the path in
<em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>, because the path's history could
have forked multiple times (thanks to copy operations) between
<em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em> and
<em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  And that's not
all—Subversion doesn't store enough information to performantly trace
an object's history forward, anyway.  So the algorithm is a little
different:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>Locate <em class="replaceable"><code>item</code></em> in the revision identified by
<em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  There can be only one such
object.</p></li>
<li><p>Trace the object's history backward (through any possible renames) to its
ancestor in the revision <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the object's location (path-wise) in
<em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em> is the same as it is in
<em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  If that's the case, at least the
two locations are known to be directly related, so perform the requested
action on the location in <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.
Otherwise, relatedness was not established, so error out with a loud
complaint that no viable location was found.  (Someday, we expect that
Subversion will be able to handle this usage scenario with more flexibility
and grace.)</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Note that even when you don't explicitly supply a peg revision or operative
revision, they are still present.  For your convenience, the default peg
revision is <code class="literal">BASE</code> for working copy items and
<code class="literal">HEAD</code> for repository URLs.  And when no operative revision
is provided, it defaults to being the same revision as the peg revision.</p>
</div>
<p>Say that long ago we created our repository, and in revision 1 we added our
first <code class="filename">concept</code> directory, plus an
<code class="filename">IDEA</code> file in that directory talking about the concept.
After several revisions in which real code was added and tweaked, we, in
revision 20, renamed this directory to
<code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code>.  By revision 27, we had a new concept,
a new <code class="filename">concept</code> directory to hold it, and a new
<code class="filename">IDEA</code> file to describe it.  And then five years and
thousands of revisions flew by, just like they would in any good romance
story.</p>
<p>Now, years later, we wonder what the <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file looked
like back in revision 1.  But Subversion needs to know whether we are asking
about how the <span class="emphasis"><em>current</em></span> file looked back in revision 1,
or whether we are asking for the contents of whatever file lived at
<code class="filename">concepts/IDEA</code> in revision 1.  Certainly those questions
have different answers, and because of peg revisions, you can ask those
questions.  To find out how the current <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file
looked in that old revision, you run:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA 
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</pre>
<p>Of course, in this example, the current <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file
didn't exist yet in revision 1, so Subversion gives an error.  The previous
command is shorthand for a longer notation which explicitly lists a peg
revision.  The expanded notation is:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA@BASE
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</pre>
<p>当执行时，它包含期望的结果。</p>
<p>The perceptive reader is probably wondering at this point whether the peg
revision syntax causes problems for working copy paths or URLs that actually
have at signs in them.  After all, how does <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> know
whether <code class="literal">news@11</code> is the name of a directory in my tree or
just a syntax for “<span class="quote">revision 11 of <code class="filename">news</code></span>”?
Thankfully, while <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> will always assume the latter,
there is a trivial workaround.  You need only append an at sign to the end
of the path, such as <code class="literal">news@11@</code>.  <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
cares only about the last at sign in the argument, and it is not considered
illegal to omit a literal peg revision specifier after that at sign.  This
workaround even applies to paths that end in an at sign—you would use
<code class="literal">filename@@</code> to talk about a file named
<code class="filename">filename@</code>.</p>
<p>Let's ask the other question, then—in revision 1, what were the
contents of whatever file occupied the address
<code class="filename">concepts/IDEA</code> at the time? We'll use an explicit peg
revision to help us out.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn cat concept/IDEA@1
The idea behind this project is to come up with a piece of software
that can frab a naggily wort.  Frabbing naggily worts is tricky
business, and doing it incorrectly can have serious ramifications, so
we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification
mechanisms.
</pre>
<p>Notice that we didn't provide an operative revision this time.  That's
because when no operative revision is specified, Subversion assumes a
default operative revision that's the same as the peg revision.</p>
<p>As you can see, the output from our operation appears to be correct.  The
text even mentions frabbing naggily worts, so this is almost certainly the
file that describes the software now called Frabnaggilywort.  In fact, we
can verify this using the combination of an explicit peg revision and
explicit operative revision.  We know that in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>, the
Frabnaggilywort project is located in the
<code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code> directory.  So we specify that we want
to see how the line of history identified in <code class="literal">HEAD</code> as the
path <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort/IDEA</code> looked in revision 1.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 1 frabnaggilywort/IDEA@HEAD
The idea behind this project is to come up with a piece of software
that can frab a naggily wort.  Frabbing naggily worts is tricky
business, and doing it incorrectly can have serious ramifications, so
we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification
mechanisms.
</pre>
<p>And the peg and operative revisions need not be so trivial, either.  For
example, say <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code> had been deleted from
<code class="literal">HEAD</code>, but we know it existed in revision 20, and we want
to see the diffs for its <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file between revisions 4
and 10.  We can use the peg revision 20 in conjunction with the URL that
would have held Frabnaggilywort's <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file in revision
20, and then use 4 and 10 as our operative revision range.</p>
